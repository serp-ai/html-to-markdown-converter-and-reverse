‘csv’.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html)

  1. csv.Reader()
  2. csv.DictReader()

Let’s explore the difference between the two options using an example .csv
file: `friends_birthdays.csv` \- it looks something like this:

name| location| birthday_month  
---|---|---  
Anthony| Tokyo| June  
Alex| Maryland| September  
  
## csv.Reader()

`csv.Reader()` let’s you read & access data in .csv files using _**indexes**_
, and it great for simple .csv files.

Using `csv.Reader()` to explore the friends_birthdays.csv file:

    
    
    import csvwith open('friends_birthdays.csv') as f:    my_csv = csv.reader(f, delimiter=',')    line_count = 0    for row in my_csv:        print(f'{row[0]} lives in {row[1]} and has a birthday in {row[2]}.')### output# name lives in location and has a birthday in birthday_month# Anthony lives in Tokyo and has a birthday in June# Alex lives in Maryland and has a birthday in September

Notice how this prints the header row in the output.

To remove that you can adjust your code to remove the header row by first
turning your read csv into a list, and then slicing off the top row.

    
    
    import csvwith open('friends_birthdays.csv') as f:    my_csv = list(csv.reader(f))    my_csv = my_csv[1:]    for row in my_csv:        print(f'{row[0]} lives in {row[1]} and birthday is {row[2]}')### output# Anthony lives in Tokyo and birthday is June# Alex lives in Maryland and birthday is September

## csv.DictReader()

`csv.DictReader()` is a more convenient option when working with larger CSV
files, but can still work for simper .csv files as well.

Using `csv.DictReader()` to explore the friends_birthdays.csv file:

    
    
    import csvwith open('friends_birthdays.csv') as file:    my_csv = csv.DictReader(file, delimiter=',')    line_count = 0    for row in my_csv:        print(f""{row['name']} lives in {row['location']} and has a birthday in {row['birthday_month']}."")### output# Anthony lives in Tokyo and has a birthday in June.# Alex lives in Maryland and has a birthday in September.","<p>There are two ways to read data from CSV files using <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html"">Python’s built-in module

Successfully working with [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) databases kind of
assumes that you have an idea of what's in your databases, right?

If you're using an application, or some kind of GUI (graphical user
interface), it might be as easy as clicking an icon to see what you're working
with.

But if you're coming in from the command line, you don't have that luxury.

In this lesson we will see how to view / list database tables in a MySQL,
Postgres, or MariaDB database from the command line.

In case you haven’t connected to MySQL yet:

  1. Open Terminal
  2. Connect to MySQL server with the following command:

    
    
    $ mysql -u root -p

When prompted for your password, enter it if you have one.

Chances are if you don’t know it - you don’t have one. So in that case just
press the `return` key.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/mysql-u-
root-p-1024x474.png)

When connected, you’re prompt will change to `mysql>`

## mysql> SHOW DATABASES;

The most obvious starting point is to figure out what databases you have to
work with.

To list your databases, use the `SHOW` statement.

    
    
    # SHOW DATABASES;mysql> SHOW DATABASES;

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/mysql-show-
databases-1024x459.png)

Switch to your deisred databases with the `USE` statement.

    
    
    # USE <database_name>;mysql> USE pixeldevs;

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/mysql-USE-
database-1024x128.png)

## mysql> SHOW TABLES;

You’re connected and ready to use a specific database.

To see the tables & views in the selected database, use the `SHOW` statement.

    
    
    # SHOW TABLES;mysql> SHOW TABLES;

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/mysql-SHOW-
TABLES-1024x712.png)

### mysql> SHOW FULL TABLES;

If you’d like a little more information about the each table’s type, add the
`FULL` modifier into your statement.

    
    
    # SHOW FULL TABLES;mysql> SHOW FULL TABLES;

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/mysql-SHOW-FULL-TABLES.png)

## mysql> SHOW TABLES FROM;

Alternatively, if you don’t want to “use” a particular database, you can run
the same commands by on different databases, and database tables, by modifying
your statement’s specificity a bit.

    
    
    # SHOW TABLES FROM <database_name>;mysql> SHOW TABLES FROM pixelsdevs;

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/show-
tables.-FROM-802x1024.png)

Alternatively you can use the `IN` clause:

    
    
    # SHOW TABLES IN <database_name>mysql> SHOW TABLES IN sales_example;mysql> SHOW TABLES IN pixeldevs;

ART) of bringing people to your website, from search engines, who are likely
to be interested in the products and services you provide.

SEO is quite literally how to **optimize** a website in such a way that a web
crawler (aka algorithm, aka
[Googlebot](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/182072?hl=en)) that
we humans refer to as "" **a search engine** "" will like your website more than
your competitor's website, and display your website prominently when someone
searches for a product / service you provide.

How do I do that for my website? How do I make my website show up above my
competitors? Well, you ""SEO it"".

## Why is SEO important?

Why is SEO important? What are the benefits of SEO?

Great questions...

Let me answer these questions, with a question: On a scale of 1-10, how likely
are people to want what you sell?

Weird question right? How do you even answer that? There are WAY too many
types of people for that question to make any sense.

How about this question: What if you could identify everyone who is actively,
currently (maybe even frantically) looking for your services and then be the
first person they call?

  *  **Newsflash** : You Can.
  *  **2nd Newsflash** : It's Awesome.
  *  **3rd Newsflash** : Never do a third newsflash. People stop paying attention after the second.

Okay enough tomfoolery - let's get into some real life examples!

## SEO for a Local Business - Is it beneficial?

We define [""local business""](https://devinschumacher.com/local-business-
website/) as any business that provides products / services in a
geographically restricted capacity.

 **For example** : surgeons, plumbers, lawyers (most), pool cleaners, surf
lessons, cryotherapy, funeral home services, etc.

Suppose your are a Dentist and you have a practice in Queen Creek, Arizona
(this is probably not true to your actual situation).

And suppose that you make some good money if you sell teeth whitening (this
however, is in fact, true).

Well, there are high-schools in that area right? I'm sure that those high
schools have prom and that people want to look good for their most important
school dance (and the parents probably want them looking sharp for school
pictures).

So what do they do?

They go to the internet and Google ""teeth whitening near me"" or ""teeth
whitening queen creek"" or ""how to get a date for prom"" .... but let's stick to
the teeth whitening example for now.

So what happens when you Google ""teeth whitening queen creek""?

You see a [SERP](https://devinschumacher.com/serp/)! [(Search
Engine](https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/) Results Page). It looks
like this:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/an-example-of-the-
benefits-of-local-seo-843x1024-1.png)

Well, it looks like that without the arrows at least.

The arrows are pointing to one of our actual clients who is benefitting from
[local seo](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo-software/).

We included the arrows to show you that we aren't all talk here - we do walk
the walk. Even if thine walks be sometimes silly.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-1-1.gif)

SEO literally matches up **people who want your products** with **your
business**.

You know, the types of people that be like:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-2-1.gif)

For the record, I know that ""be like"" isn't proper grammar. Okay back to the
topic at hand.

SEO is one of the most powerful ways of growing your business by leveraging
the most frequented reference book (aka index, aka database) for finding
things that the world has ever seen - the internet. And primarily, Google.

## SEO for a Non Local Business - Is it beneficial?

We define ""non-local business"" as any business that provides products /
services in a non-geographically restricted capacity.

Internally, we call them ""enterprise"" businesses, so you may see that
somewhere on our website. Don't freak out.

 **For example:** an e-commerce brand, a content brand that sells info
products, a business coach, an online magazine/publisher, an affiliate
website, etc.

Suppose, this time, you are a content brand that sells informational type
products for Men be better at being men, by giving you information about what
makes a man a man, you know Knowledge For Men!

That was a fun sentence. But looks - this is real.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/knowledge-ofr-
men-1024x803-1.png)

You provide advice to guys about how to do things that aren't so common sense.

And if we're being honest, most things that have to do with being a guy don't
come as common sense to us guys - so there is actually a very large market for
this.

And suppose that you make some good money by providing awesome content for
guys, and then selling them products to help be even better guys (like books,
online courses, or even personal coaching).

Well, remember that prom coming up just around the corner in Queen Creek,
Arizona? (and pretty much everywhere else too)?

Guess what - guys are gonna need help with getting dates, and learning how to
talk to girls, and probably even how to tie their shoes.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/terrible-shoe-
ties-1024x576-1.jpg)

So what do they do?

They go to the internet and Google something like ""how to date a woman"" or
""how to be good with women"".

And what happens when you Google these things?

You see a SERP! (Search Engine Results Page). And it looks like this:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/an-example-of-how-
seo-is-beneficial-for-enterprise-comapnies-1024x923-1.png)

or this:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/another-example-of-
how-seo-impacts-businesses-in-a-positive-way-1024x885-1.png)

Once again, it looks like that without the arrows.

The arrows are pointing to one of our actual clients who is benefitting from
non-local seo (aka enterprise seo, aka just ""seo"").

And remember what happens when we show you that we aren't all talk? That we
actually walk the walk?

Ya, you remember:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-3-1.gif)

Once again we have an example of how SEO is driving **people with specific
needs** (traffic) to the **place that has the solution** for those specific
needs (your business).

Let's take a little bit deeper look of what SEO is actually doing for this
website:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-09-04_at_5_51_53_pm-1024x755-1.png)

We can see from this screenshot that this ONE article on Knowledge For Men
(KFM) is bringing the website over 100 unique visitors every month (and
growing rapidly).

When you start thinking about scaling that effort up (more articles, more SEO)
then you begin to a produce a HUGE business impact.

Here is how this is working at scale for the KFM as a whole:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-09-04_at_5_55_08_pm-1024x557-1.png)

You read that right.

That is 18,324 estimated visitors every month to this website SOLELY from
organic search efforts (aka SEO).

## How does SEO work?

Okay so first let's recap:

  1. SEO = ""Search Engine Optimization"".
  2. SEO is the process of ""doing things to my website"" so that the search engines like my website more than my competitors and will display it first.
  3. SEO is like a matchmaker that matches up: ""Person with need"" to ""Business that solves need.""
  4. [SEO brings people to your website who need/want the products & services you provide, but don't necessarily know about you as the provider](https://devinschumacher.com/pr-seo/). They only know what they want to solve, like ""teeth whitening near me"" or ""how to date a woman"". SEO is the connection between that ""generic search"" to YOUR brand.

Got it? Awesome.

I want to keep this article at a beginner level, so I'm actually not going to
go too in-depth with how seo works from a technical level - we will cover that
in an upcoming article.

But the gist of it is that Google has a very complex
[algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) that us SEOs spend all of
our time ""trying to please"".

Once we figure out ""What A Google Wants"" (insert [Christina
Aguilera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpspGHeLOPE) joke) then Google
rewards us by putting our website on the top of their search engine & sending
us their searches to do with what we please.

 **Inside SERP University we cover this extensively, but for all you newbies
here are the 3 most important things you can do for your SEO:**

  1. Create good content (like the article you are reading)
  2. Get other websites to link to your content (literally go find relevant websites that are in your industry. Email them. And ask them if they will link to your website from their ""Resources"" page, or from a relevant article on their blog, etc.)
  3. Make sure your website is setup/structured correctly (just like you would want your house to be built properly and logically, you want you want to do this with your website)

Seriously, some of y'all come to us with the website equivalent of this:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/house1.jpg)

You can't build your house (website) like this and expect search engines to
take you seriously.

## Types of SEO

Just when you thought you had a handle on things, we have to expand on the
topic and tell you that there are actually different types of seo.

Reminds me of those subjects you would learn in school (like Spanish) for
years only to find out right before going on the class trip to Spain that
""everything you just learned is actually all formal speech people don't really
talk like that, so next year were gonna have to re-learn a bunch of things
right when you thought you had it figured out.""

But just stick with me and you will get it.

Just like I learned Spanish.

Lo prometo.

 **The main types of SEO:**

  * [Black Hat SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/black-hat-seo/)
  * [White Hat SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/white-hat-seo/)
  * Technical SEO
  * [Content SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/what-is-content-marketing/)
  * [Local SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/)
  * [Link Building SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/link-building/)

For now, thats all you need to know.

There are different ""types"" (aka specialties, aka areas of expertise) inside
of SEO.

<p>Well, it looks like that without the arrows at least.</p>
<p>The arrows are pointing to one of our actual clients who is benefitting from
<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo-software/"">local seo</a>.</p>
<p>We included the arrows to show you that we aren't all talk here - we do walk
the walk. Even if thine walks be sometimes silly.</p>

<p>SEO literally matches up <strong>people who want your products</strong> with <strong>your
business</strong>.</p>
<p>You know, the types of people that be like:</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-2-1.gif"" /></p>
<p>For the record, I know that ""be like"" isn't proper grammar. Okay back to the
topic at hand.</p>
<p>SEO is one of the most powerful ways of growing your business by leveraging
the most frequented reference book (aka index, aka database) for finding
things that the world has ever seen - the internet. And primarily, Google.</p>
<h2>SEO for a Non Local Business - Is it beneficial?</h2>
<p>We define ""non-local business"" as any business that provides products /
services in a non-geographically restricted capacity.</p>
<p>Internally, we call them ""enterprise"" businesses, so you may see that
somewhere on our website. Don't freak out.</p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong> an e-commerce brand, a content brand that sells info
products, a business coach, an online magazine/publisher, an affiliate
website, etc.</p>
<p>Suppose, this time, you are a content brand that sells informational type
products for Men be better at being men, by giving you information about what
makes a man a man, you know Knowledge For Men!</p>
<p>That was a fun sentence. But looks - this is real.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/knowledge-ofr-
men-1024x803-1.png"" /></p>
<p>You provide advice to guys about how to do things that aren't so common sense.</p>
<p>And if we're being honest, most things that have to do with being a guy don't
come as common sense to us guys - so there is actually a very large market for
this.</p>
<p>And suppose that you make some good money by providing awesome content for
guys, and then selling them products to help be even better guys (like books,
online courses, or even personal coaching).</p>
<p>Well, remember that prom coming up just around the corner in Queen Creek,
Arizona? (and pretty much everywhere else too)?</p>
<p>Guess what - guys are gonna need help with getting dates, and learning how to
talk to girls, and probably even how to tie their shoes.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/terrible-shoe-
ties-1024x576-1.jpg"" /></p>
<p>So what do they do?</p>
<p>They go to the internet and Google something like ""how to date a woman"" or
""how to be good with women"".</p>
<p>And what happens when you Google these things?</p>
<p>You see a SERP! (Search Engine Results Page). And it looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/an-example-of-how-
seo-is-beneficial-for-enterprise-comapnies-1024x923-1.png"" /></p>
<p>or this:</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/another-example-of-
how-seo-impacts-businesses-in-a-positive-way-1024x885-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Once again, it looks like that without the arrows.</p>
<p>The arrows are pointing to one of our actual clients who is benefitting from
non-local seo (aka enterprise seo, aka just ""seo"").</p>
<p>And remember what happens when we show you that we aren't all talk? That we
actually walk the walk?</p>
<p>Ya, you remember:</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-3-1.gif"" /></p>
<p>Once again we have an example of how SEO is driving <strong>people with specific
needs</strong> (traffic) to the <strong>place that has the solution</strong> for those specific
needs (your business).</p>
<p>Let's take a little bit deeper look of what SEO is actually doing for this
website:</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-09-04_at_5_51_53_pm-1024x755-1.png"" /></p>
<p>We can see from this screenshot that this ONE article on Knowledge For Men
(KFM) is bringing the website over 100 unique visitors every month (and
growing rapidly).</p>
<p>When you start thinking about scaling that effort up (more articles, more SEO)
then you begin to a produce a HUGE business impact.</p>
<p>Here is how this is working at scale for the KFM as a whole:</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-09-04_at_5_55_08_pm-1024x557-1.png"" /></p>
<p>You read that right.</p>
<p>That is 18,324 estimated visitors every month to this website SOLELY from
organic search efforts (aka SEO).</p>
<h2>How does SEO work?</h2>
<p>Okay so first let's recap:</p>
<ol>
<li>SEO = ""Search Engine Optimization"".</li>
<li>SEO is the process of ""doing things to my website"" so that the search engines like my website more than my competitors and will display it first.</li>
<li>SEO is like a matchmaker that matches up: ""Person with need"" to ""Business that solves need.""</li>
<li><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/pr-seo/"">SEO brings people to your website who need/want the products &amp; services you provide, but don't necessarily know about you as the provider</a>. They only know what they want to solve, like ""teeth whitening near me"" or ""how to date a woman"". SEO is the connection between that ""generic search"" to YOUR brand.</li>
</ol>
<p>Got it? Awesome.</p>
<p>I want to keep this article at a beginner level, so I'm actually not going to
go too in-depth with how seo works from a technical level - we will cover that
in an upcoming article.</p>
<p>But the gist of it is that Google has a very complex
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm"">algorithm</a> that us SEOs spend all of
our time ""trying to please"".</p>
<p>Once we figure out ""What A Google Wants"" (insert <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpspGHeLOPE"">Christina
Aguilera</a> joke) then Google
rewards us by putting our website on the top of their search engine &amp; sending
us their searches to do with what we please.</p>
<p><strong>Inside SERP University we cover this extensively, but for all you newbies
here are the 3 most important things you can do for your SEO:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Create good content (like the article you are reading)</li>
<li>Get other websites to link to your content (literally go find relevant websites that are in your industry. Email them. And ask them if they will link to your website from their ""Resources"" page, or from a relevant article on their blog, etc.)</li>
<li>Make sure your website is setup/structured correctly (just like you would want your house to be built properly and logically, you want you want to do this with your website)</li>
</ol>
<p>Seriously, some of y'all come to us with the website equivalent of this:</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/house1.jpg"" /></p>
<p>You can't build your house (website) like this and expect search engines to
take you seriously.</p>
<h2>Types of SEO</h2>
<p>Just when you thought you had a handle on things, we have to expand on the
topic and tell you that there are actually different types of seo.</p>
<p>Reminds me of those subjects you would learn in school (like Spanish) for
years only to find out right before going on the class trip to Spain that
""everything you just learned is actually all formal speech people don't really
talk like that, so next year were gonna have to re-learn a bunch of things
right when you thought you had it figured out.""</p>
<p>But just stick with me and you will get it.</p>
<p>Just like I learned Spanish.</p>
<p>Lo prometo.</p>
<p><strong>The main types of SEO:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/black-hat-seo/"">Black Hat SEO</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/white-hat-seo/"">White Hat SEO</a></li>
<li>Technical SEO</li>
<li><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/what-is-content-marketing/"">Content SEO</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/"">Local SEO</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/link-building/"">Link Building SEO</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For now, thats all you need to know.</p>
<p>There are different ""types"" (aka specialties, aka areas of expertise) inside
of SEO.</p>
<p>We will dive into each one later.</p>"

On-page SEO (also known as on-site SEO) in simple terms, is everything we can
do on our website to affect SEO.

Every page is unique and has its own necessary optimization. The concept both
refers to individual webpages, and the whole site.  

Comparatively off-page SEO are actions taken outside of your website to
influence SEO. It’s important to know the difference.

## Why Is On-Page SEO Important?

On-page SEO is important because it helps search engines recognize what your
content is about.

Google wants to find out how relevant content is to keywords. It wants to
understand websites in the context of what people are searching for.

On-page SEO is about telling Google what it’s crawling, indexing and ranking.
It’s telling them what it should look like on SERPs.

## On-page SEO Elements (The Fundamentals)

To understand how any concept works, you need to know the fundamentals.

On-page SEO is not complex—there are specific ranking elements that affect on-
page SEO. Once you understand these elements, you can easily optimize any
webpage.

**There are 3 main on-page SEO elements:**

  1. Content 
  2. HTML 
  3. Website Architecture  

### Content Elements

  * [Keyword Research](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/#4-keyword-research)
  * [Search Intent](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/#5-search-intent)
  * [Text Content](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/#6-text-content-)
  * [Media Content](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/#7-media-content)

Content on-page SEO ranking elements are the elements of your website’s copy
and content. Here we are focusing on the quality of page content.

 **Content quality has 2 main implications we must consider.**

  1. How it affects user experience—did they like it, were they informed/educated/entertained
  2. How user experience is communicated to Google—time on page/dwell time, bounce rate, backlinks

The focus is **user experience**.

#### Keyword Research

Keyword research is the process of analyzing words/phrases that people are
searching for. These words/phrases are called keywords.

 **Keyword Research will let you know:**

  * What keywords people are searching for
  * How often/frequently they are searching for keywords
  * How they are searching for those keywords

The right keywords will allow you to rank well on SERPs—putting you in prime
position to reap in organic traffic.

  * **Related Reading** : Check out our full article on Keyword Research. 

#### Search Intent

Search Intent, or user intent, is the primary goal an individual has when they
type search queries into search engines.

 **Search Intent:** What they are looking for

 **Search Query:** What they type into Google

The search queries people type into Google don't always line up with what
they're looking for.

**Common types of Search Intent include:**

  * Informational - Information on something
  * Commercial - Buying something
  * Navigational - Directions to somewhere

Search Intent is important for SEO because it is a ranking factor. It is the
primary, idealistic goal for all search engines, [especially
Google](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/search-intent-marketing-
funnel/#/).

Google's algorithm is intelligent—it closely watches user activity on
different search queries. It notices which ranked webpages are being clicked
on—they are rewarded.

When you create content, you need to have a search intent in mind.

  * **Related Reading** : Check out our full article on Search Intent. 

#### Text Content

With the right keywords and search intent in place, you can now begin to write
the content.

Writing content for the internet is not complicated. It is simply a matter of
writing a specific style. You want to write _scannable content_.

> _“Scannable content is short, sweet and to the point. Sentences and
> paragraphs are brief. Bold text and bullet points highlight key points.”_
>
> [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansutter/2015/12/18/the-most-
> overlooked-factor-of-content-marketing/)[
> ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansutter/2015/12/18/the-most-overlooked-
> factor-of-content-marketing/)

Scannable content maximizes readability—it is written at a level everyone can
understand. You don't get points for writing like an academic.

 **Here are some keys to follow.**

  * Incorporate keywords in a natural fashion, no stuffing
  * Keyword in 1st 100 words
  * Keep sentence length under 20 words
  * Keep paragraphs 3-4 lines max
  * Use subheadings to breakup/structure post 
  * Keyword in at least one subheading (H2/H3)
  * Use bullet points/lists to breakdown specific points of information

#### Media Content

Great content is not complete without some media content.

Media content are the visual assets of webpages—the images, GIFs, videos. It
is important to include media content because it simply makes your content
better. [Blog posts with images get 94% more
traffic](https://www.jeffbullas.com/6-powerful-reasons-why-you-should-include-
images-in-your-marketing-infographic/) than those without.

Images are also processed [60,000x faster than
text](http://www.t-sciences.com/news/humans-process-visual-data-better). The
age-old saying ""a picture is worth a thousand words"" is actually true.

Litter your content with media content to improve readability, and further
breakup the monotony of walls of text.

Some types of media content you can use include:

  * Images
  * Video
  * GIFs
  * Infographics
  * Interactive Content

### HTML Elements

  * [Page Titles](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/#9-page-titles-title-tags)
  * [Meta Description](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/#10-meta-description)
  * [Image Alt-Text](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/#12-image-alt-text)
  * [Image Title](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/#13-image-title)
  * [Image Filename](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/#14-image-filename)
  * [Geotagging](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/#15-geotagging-for-local-related-queries)
  * [Structured Data](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/#16-structured-data)
  * [Keyword Density](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/#18-keyword-density)

HTML Markup relates to the elements that make up your web source code. HTML is
a basic coding language that is used to make websites and webpages.

HTML looks like this.

[![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8t-1YtqNeQJlpI2LGOLvAB5r7iojSvSZz5I43O0s1IRKcQqzSz0gfzWisYUe1jP1Zdd9-n9jWLsXpdufgwJWUlQP8wmJ1nCDJQUAYKg5XzuuJIK-
vUvfpb2fKK3ywl3NGOGvymGR)](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8t-1YtqNeQJlpI2LGOLvAB5r7iojSvSZz5I43O0s1IRKcQqzSz0gfzWisYUe1jP1Zdd9-n9jWLsXpdufgwJWUlQP8wmJ1nCDJQUAYKg5XzuuJIK-
vUvfpb2fKK3ywl3NGOGvymGR)

Before CMS platforms like WordPress and Squarespace made web design easy, it
was left to coders.

Aside from the design of websites and webpages, HTML also tells search engines
what it is. This is important because search engines like Google use that
information to rank webpages in context of things people search for.

You can view the HTML of any page.

Simply right click on any webpage and click “ **View page source** ”.

[![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/1uWrBMLcxVJeWmSZG6Ln3jLxgUIaACyNRPXlcXqEoFNzH19-477mM3wudJ78pFPDmkcdfw1-IV-

IwxJvQ8e_yCHg_BNFLpfzfJuBeHCjh4Wnk8Po4Zw4hRhxzcusidXM4x6JywE0) (This is for
Google Chrome browser)

**HTML has 2 focus points you need to consider for on-page SEO.**

  1. Keyword Placement: page titles, headings, image alt-text/filename 
  2. SERP Representation: meta description, geo-tagging, schema markup/SERP features

It does not need to get more complicated then this.

  * **Related Reading** : Check out our full article on SEO HTML Elements. 

#### Page Titles (Title Tags)

The page title is the most important place to put a keyword. The page title
tells people and search engines what that webpage is about.

This is what the page title looks like on SERPs.

[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/M8uZa9x6JDCmh0kPUUh5EVeAjR2H3jWZPf0oONf6qLtm5uwThA0ir1z2V5NVJf0JnhJYuWJKY4DFIm-

IlEfx8HCrR5SPhORzv5JM014TOcTaIb4rXtpLYuBuNTCiWKbH-adbevAT)

It can also be seen on web browsers.

[![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/eZcDmCLzP_TzOrWnqiBpXcu5TFcmS-
lgR0ho_EMXNqUkcpx_MIQEJNdYLrU-

OMsbUJzo3rEkrFUx230mjv5t2KtadUVnkdVF4DLWRM1hkWMPh8fDvqbpFJn9cpSABK_FPeTfFrw5)

In the HTML source code the page title will look like this.

[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a5zGtF2CoqlEAiMxlu0X4skS9GS4zPNJRp3-OY
--Sd8oBFEzaPcR7OLZ5tLfZKh1pvvMA-

TY5goIuTZmNOsBxICSKvzJNuV_EArDV8LewDdW5cpwAE_l5O-4KlJYvT6sjmLFdoZt)

This is also why the page title is referred to as title tags.

  * **Related Reading** : Check out our full article on Title Tags. 

#### Meta Description

The meta description is your webpage SERP blurb. It looks like this.

[![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lXzXaKGezBNxlbW_mFil7OWQI9c35LB9JeuYGOdz5mSKk9OA_M_wd5U45OXiEBS36XXlbrXtn0eFflJ_roCgq98lJ0Gj4vzo4GsnHzyjM0hOitA5fAQcKF-

egN-ePyafOsYnsJzg)

It does not directly affect SEO. [It is not a ranking
factor](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/09/google-does-not-
use-keywords-meta-tag.html). Putting a keyword here will not have direct
search engine implications like it would elsewhere.

It does however affect click-through rates.

The meta description acts to entice and persuade search engine users to visit.

A better meta description will have a higher click-through rate, sending more
traffic to your webpage. More traffic will earn you more backlinks, a higher
domain authority, among a host of things.

So it can impact SEO indirectly—which is why it’s important to consider.

#### Image Optimization

Images have their own HTML optimization for on-page seo. We may see the image,
but search engines see the HTML code. The image might always look the same to
us, but depending on the HTML it can be very different to search engines.

You can view the HTML source code for any image. **Right click on the image
and select “Inspect”**

[![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/0-70qfAh7iNUxYYLrbEdYKzZmIjP4kmzSrxqacQckFOSOEJnLreYjCYwyC3Y_vHNbcUiLAzYaCTpO4iNJ2uzadTuNDTXSejVyVaIxJmKM1-qf45lJbThhFpt-0-RmFvazrhUDj_g)](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/0-70qfAh7iNUxYYLrbEdYKzZmIjP4kmzSrxqacQckFOSOEJnLreYjCYwyC3Y_vHNbcUiLAzYaCTpO4iNJ2uzadTuNDTXSejVyVaIxJmKM1-qf45lJbThhFpt-0-RmFvazrhUDj_g)

The HTML code should come up. It is highlighted in blue.

 **There are 3 things we must consider for image on-page SEO.**

  1. Image Alt-Text
  2. Image Title
  3. Image Filename

cBnx9w8wZiOI8Oy-LchH9TokUKE6flLd-nsM9e9FACtlfuK)

##### Image Alt-Text

The image alt-text can also be known as the alt attribute, or alt description.
It is used to tell search engines what an image is about. It also helps those
who can’t view images or have low bandwidth internet connections.

 **The alt-text is essentially a long-tail keyword for images.  **

This is important because people can find your website through images. When
people do an image search, they often click through to the website the image
came from.

I found Serp Co through an image search.

[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Xwu7DWlWGVQPWMSTzzlRLvkI5RBA2ToS9KP6mWz94nV5m77YpjoEQOCNLM2enw2xyaSnTFL2kV19SZJMhf35TSW1pPX0ohnxDP5S8A1aqwZ8hMcna-W8eHc4tXIYZNpU716a1QJ1)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Xwu7DWlWGVQPWMSTzzlRLvkI5RBA2ToS9KP6mWz94nV5m77YpjoEQOCNLM2enw2xyaSnTFL2kV19SZJMhf35TSW1pPX0ohnxDP5S8A1aqwZ8hMcna-W8eHc4tXIYZNpU716a1QJ1)

A good alt-text can also make an image appear for a larger net of search
queries/terms.

[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_-1SUjrD69i86J6lmoAbTWlJqHgmIFrz8gKlXErun45G4Fu01tzVEVfY_p1CD5y3n2oS7pAa3fbz1QX_Tdzv5w32mJra01oKRc0_5kece_3DTcK1IZv1MeYmds6o1axGGWWPQcEU)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_-1SUjrD69i86J6lmoAbTWlJqHgmIFrz8gKlXErun45G4Fu01tzVEVfY_p1CD5y3n2oS7pAa3fbz1QX_Tdzv5w32mJra01oKRc0_5kece_3DTcK1IZv1MeYmds6o1axGGWWPQcEU)[![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BJRr3CKizcePvNHZDPY5D5lufihjQwnT5sRJvIQfFtScdssexT7JV6D1fgJTCl_T6PWjX2cCXNT8Xq_3pd1m0V8yRiWkPTZz7VwM_6QBunUiY1e7lsJ01pu_P_s-1oyz1hgL6Y91)](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BJRr3CKizcePvNHZDPY5D5lufihjQwnT5sRJvIQfFtScdssexT7JV6D1fgJTCl_T6PWjX2cCXNT8Xq_3pd1m0V8yRiWkPTZz7VwM_6QBunUiY1e7lsJ01pu_P_s-1oyz1hgL6Y91)

This creates even more pathways to your website.

##### Image Title

The image title attribute is used to provide additional information. It does
not impact SEO, therefore it is not as important as alt-text or filename.

It is the little pop-up that can appear when you put your cursor on an image.

[![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hkrQVXRDsG3Mpr7EQbXr0LKiQ7qGjNAy6_RsDd48lYJqIxv-

##### Image Filename

The image filename is the unique name given to images. It is used by search
engines to help rank and index images. Just like alt-text it is important
because image searches are a pathway to your website.

  * **Related Reading** : Check out our full article on Image Filename. 

#### Geotagging (For Local Related Queries)

Geotagging is when you attribute a geographical location to a specific webpage
and/or its content. This content can include images and videos for example.

When you geotag an image or video, you are giving search engines very specific
information. It will allow you to appear on SERPs for search queries with a
location.

""Pet stores in Manhattan"" for example.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/09/image-9.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/09/image-9.png)

When you geotag webpages and content, you are giving search engines more and
more information. The more information you give them, the better.

It is an effective SEO strategy for local related search queries.

  * **Related Reading** : Check out our full article on Local SEO. 

#### Structured Data

Structured Data are HTML tags you can add that make crawling, indexing and
ranking easier. It improves the way search engines read your webpages,
resulting in better SERP representation.

Utilizing structured data can help content of your webpage show up as SERP
features.

##### SERP Features

SERP features are special results you see on search engine results pages.

Here is an example.

The incentive of SERP features are that people can get answers to questions
without clicking through. It is priority positioning with unique, additional
information.

Although structured data is not considered a ranking factor, SERP features
generally have higher click-through rates. Much like a good meta description,
this can indirectly affect SEO.

 **There are many types of SERP features** (with Google creating more almost
daily), but we will cover a few of the main ones:

##### Rich Snippets

#### Keyword Density

Keyword density is the frequency, or how often keywords are used on a single
webpage. This isn’t just how many times a keyword is used, but how often it is
used.

 **Keyword density = number. of times keyword used ÷ total number of words**

Keyword density used to be extremely important for SEO. Because of that, low
quality keyword stuffed content was considered ideal.

That is no longer the case.

[Google evolved their algorithm in
2013](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2013/08/in-depth-articles-in-search-
results.html), to punish black hat (illegal) keyword stuffing. They want high
quality content, not cheap tricks to game the system.

> _“Keyword density, in general, is something I wouldn’t focus on. Search
> engines have kind of moved on from there._ "" (2014)
>
> [John Meuller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmu/), Senior Google Webmaster
> Trends Analyst

As such, keyword density is no longer as important—but it still needs
consideration.

### Website Architecture Elements

  * [Site Speed](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/#20-site-speed)
  * [Responsive Design](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/#21-responsive-design)
  * [URL Structure](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/#22-url-structure)
  * [Internal Links](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/#23-internal-links)
  * [External (Outbound) Links](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/#24-external-outbound-links)
  * [Duplicate Content](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/#25-duplicate-content-avoid-it)

Website architecture is less about optimizing a specific _page_ and more about
optimizing the website as a whole.

Better structuring your website architecture allows search engines like Google
to crawl and index easier.

This is usually done by your technical SEO team, and we have a dedicated
resource about this, but it is worth mentioning here briefly, as any on page
SEO guide would not be complete without at least covering the basics.

  * **Related Reading** : Check out our full article on Website Architecture / Sitemaps. 

#### Site Speed

How fast a page loads is very important. Google analyzes user experience to
better rank your site and content.

What does it say about your site when visitors leave before the page even
loads?

There are many negative consequences to a slow site speed. The most obvious is
**bounce rate**.

[![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/EeQm60NqYj3JCFfnCNS70AykeCZ-
aAINZbd195TXfd-
wy0rYMTryYtoeMRonbYFCJXg0vOlmPzf8q7faXktwmv5J6AA9orG4DM-4lS6tFc0I3wLX9nixCD7ozrSlOeVsJ66ruyFM)](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/EeQm60NqYj3JCFfnCNS70AykeCZ-

Tests have shown [bounce rate increases as page loading time
increases](https://developer.akamai.com/blog/2015/09/01/mobile-web-
performance-monitoring-conversion-rate).

[![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZLLCRGjB3nEDkGsVdxwZm50CzWpeuM8PXqHWOmcg6vT53EHvVdoW2NbN_VJLoQ61Xy7dLGiIYZeJcgu_VtJDKkXHvNmPlBpZZ6KUANUglYss1h8l92RmpyYwIDWFeH0tYVoJbL_q)](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZLLCRGjB3nEDkGsVdxwZm50CzWpeuM8PXqHWOmcg6vT53EHvVdoW2NbN_VJLoQ61Xy7dLGiIYZeJcgu_VtJDKkXHvNmPlBpZZ6KUANUglYss1h8l92RmpyYwIDWFeH0tYVoJbL_q)  

[Google has also done their own tests](https://www.link-
assistant.com/news/mobile-seo-2018.html). Increasing page load time increased
bounce rate dramatically.

[![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/S-Yr3yemDzkn8kRXaXC2CZTwKxNXCh6yNy4H0TECUlW81F2yrQJ8p4CrAiuQGRgqwINLEh0751sCF-

wBQTJzGxBJgbRY6DrONYJguHx1_MbpPwhSrgty8OPYm-VoSLbQIJccKuSK)

[Page speed is also a Google ranking
factor](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/01/using-page-speed-in-mobile-
search.html) for mobile searches, which makes up majority of searches
nowadays.

It’s best to maximize site speed to get the best user experience possible.

#### Responsive Design

A responsive design is a website design that adapts to the screen dimensions
of the device used.

[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wIniWsnypgq8sZBrQRyBRy3L_x73k8Mh4eCKo5KM_sy3p8EfyR9b0Si2gYMvrX7qzX79YIJYj4Xk1RbKX1JUbTYO-00JmtuMRqgQJc2PU-

uC5a4ckpWJk0MrvidnIw-g2m_AU6Xp)

In a world where [mobile accounts for 58% of website
traffic](https://www.stonetemple.com/mobile-vs-desktop-usage-study/),
responsive design is essential to maximize user experience.  

[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FC-MofIlztUO-qv4F6rCAZXk0q8AWmiaDX-

The main benefit of a responsive design has always been about user experience.

That hasn't changed.

In recent times however, search engines have evolved to reward websites with
responsive designs. This is mostly to do with the ever increasing focus on
mobile usage.

The infamous 2015
""[Mobilegeddon](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2015/04/rolling-out-mobile-
friendly-update.html)"" Google update prioritized webpages with optimal mobile
design, giving them priority positioning on mobile SERPs.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/word-
image-83.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/word-
image-83.png)

The focus on mobile has only gotten more dramatic since then.

[Google's index now prioritizes
mobile](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2018/03/rolling-out-mobile-first-
indexing.html)—websites with features like a responsive design, will be
rewarded.

Responsive design is commonplace, a necessity going into the future. It is
essential to improve your SEO efforts.

#### URL Structure

URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is also known as the website
address. It is located in the top left corner of internet browsers.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/09/image-8.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/09/image-8.png)

**There are 4 main parts to a URL.**

[![url structure for seo](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/09/seo-url.jpg)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/09/seo-url.jpg) source: seopressor

  1.  **Protocol** : Either HTTP or HTTPs
  2.  **Domain Name:** The unique purchased domain name
  3.  **Subdirectories** : Category/group of pages
  4.  **Specific Page Name** : The specific individual page

Some websites (like us) don't show the ""protocol"" HTTP/HTTPs section of the
web address URL. It is purely a marketing/aesthetic decision, even though it
still is technically there.

How you structure your URLs is important because it can impact SEO.

URLs are actually small ranking factors for search engines. Brian Dean of
Backlinko reported [URLs featuring a keyword increased click-through rate by
45%](https://backlinko.com/google-ctr-stats).

A good URL structure can also increase user experience, indirectly influencing
SEO. Microsoft discovered that [""descriptive"" URLs had 25% higher click-
through rates](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/10/13/organic-seo-ctr-
infographic).

The URL is something you should not forget to address.

#### Internal Links

Internal linking is the process of hyperlinking from one page to another, on
the same website.

It helps create a better link architecture for Googlebot to crawl and index.
This better spreads link equity across a website, providing substantial SEO
benefits.

In fact, [Internal links have been shown to increase organic traffic by
40%](https://ninjaoutreach.com/internal-linking-case-study/).

#### External (Outbound) Links

External links are hyperlinks that go to another website/domain.

 **There are 2 types of external links.**

  1. Ones you receive (inbound/backlinks)
  2. Ones you make (outbound links)

Backlinks are considered one of the [top 3 Google ranking
factors](https://searchengineland.com/now-know-googles-top-three-search-
ranking-factors-245882). This is not terribly shocking. Anyone with even a
novice understanding of SEO knows this.

What’s more unknown, is the value of outbound links.

Outbound links are not specifically a ranking factor. It can however
indirectly influence SEO by improving user experience.

> “Linking to other websites is a great way to provide value to your users.
> Often times, links help users to find out more, to check out your sources
> and to better understand how your content is relevant to the questions that
> they have.” (2019)

#### Duplicate Content (Avoid it)

Duplicate content is content that is a copy, or similar to other content on
the web. This can be either on different sites or the same one.

[![Image result for duplicate content](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/09/duplicate-
content-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/09/duplicate-content-1.png)source: Moz

Here’s [Google's definition of duplicate
content](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66359?hl=en#targetText=Duplicate%20content%20generally%20refers%20to,is%20not%20deceptive%20in%20origin.).  

> _“Duplicate content generally refers to substantive blocks of content within
> or across domains that either completely match other content or are
> appreciably similar.”_

Duplicate content can negatively impact SEO.

Google does not want to index duplicate content. They prioritize indexing
original, unique informative content. This is what they want to appear on
SERPs.

It is essential that you avoid creating duplicate content.

## Final Thoughts

On-page SEO is everything you can do on your website to improve your search
engine efforts.

In this post we covered the basics.

Everything you can do on-site, to improve your search engine efforts. It is
all right here.","<h2>What Is On-Page SEO?</h2>
<p>On-page SEO (also known as on-site SEO) in simple terms, is everything we can
do on our website to affect SEO.</p>
<p>Every page is unique and has its own necessary optimization. The concept both
refers to individual webpages, and the whole site.  </p>
<p>Comparatively off-page SEO are actions taken outside of your website to
influence SEO. It’s important to know the difference.</p>
<h2>Why Is On-Page SEO Important?</h2>
<p>On-page SEO is important because it helps search engines recognize what your
content is about.</p>
<p>Google wants to find out how relevant content is to keywords. It wants to
understand websites in the context of what people are searching for.</p>
<p>On-page SEO is about telling Google what it’s crawling, indexing and ranking.
It’s telling them what it should look like on SERPs.</p>
<h2>On-page SEO Elements (The Fundamentals)</h2>
<p>To understand how any concept works, you need to know the fundamentals.</p>
<p>On-page SEO is not complex—there are specific ranking elements that affect on-
page SEO. Once you understand these elements, you can easily optimize any
webpage.</p>
<p><strong>There are 3 main on-page SEO elements:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Content </li>
<li>HTML </li>
<li>Website Architecture  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Content Elements</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/#4-keyword-research"">Keyword Research</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/#5-search-intent"">Search Intent</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/#6-text-content-"">Text Content</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/#7-media-content"">Media Content</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Content on-page SEO ranking elements are the elements of your website’s copy
and content. Here we are focusing on the quality of page content.</p>
<p><strong>Content quality has 2 main implications we must consider.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>How it affects user experience—did they like it, were they informed/educated/entertained</li>
<li>How user experience is communicated to Google—time on page/dwell time, bounce rate, backlinks</li>
</ol>
<p>The focus is <strong>user experience</strong>.</p>
<h4>Keyword Research</h4>
<p>Keyword research is the process of analyzing words/phrases that people are
searching for. These words/phrases are called keywords.</p>
<p><strong>Keyword Research will let you know:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What keywords people are searching for</li>
<li>How often/frequently they are searching for keywords</li>
<li>How they are searching for those keywords</li>
</ul>
<p>The right keywords will allow you to rank well on SERPs—putting you in prime
position to reap in organic traffic.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Related Reading</strong> : Check out our full article on Keyword Research. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Search Intent</h4>
<p>Search Intent, or user intent, is the primary goal an individual has when they
type search queries into search engines.</p>
<p><strong>Search Intent:</strong> What they are looking for</p>
<p><strong>Search Query:</strong> What they type into Google</p>
<p>The search queries people type into Google don't always line up with what
they're looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Common types of Search Intent include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Informational - Information on something</li>
<li>Commercial - Buying something</li>
<li>Navigational - Directions to somewhere</li>
</ul>
<p>Search Intent is important for SEO because it is a ranking factor. It is the
primary, idealistic goal for all search engines, <a href=""https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/search-intent-marketing-
funnel/#/"">especially
Google</a>.</p>
<p>Google's algorithm is intelligent—it closely watches user activity on
different search queries. It notices which ranked webpages are being clicked
on—they are rewarded.</p>
<p>When you create content, you need to have a search intent in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Related Reading</strong> : Check out our full article on Search Intent. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Text Content</h4>
<p>With the right keywords and search intent in place, you can now begin to write
the content.</p>
<p>Writing content for the internet is not complicated. It is simply a matter of
writing a specific style. You want to write <em>scannable content</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Scannable content is short, sweet and to the point. Sentences and
paragraphs are brief. Bold text and bullet points highlight key points.”</em></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansutter/2015/12/18/the-most-
overlooked-factor-of-content-marketing/"">Forbes</a><a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansutter/2015/12/18/the-most-overlooked-
factor-of-content-marketing/"">
</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scannable content maximizes readability—it is written at a level everyone can
understand. You don't get points for writing like an academic.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some keys to follow.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Incorporate keywords in a natural fashion, no stuffing</li>
<li>Keyword in 1st 100 words</li>
<li>Keep sentence length under 20 words</li>
<li>Keep paragraphs 3-4 lines max</li>
<li>Use subheadings to breakup/structure post </li>
<li>Keyword in at least one subheading (H2/H3)</li>
<li>Use bullet points/lists to breakdown specific points of information</li>
</ul>
<h4>Media Content</h4>
<p>Great content is not complete without some media content.</p>
<p>Media content are the visual assets of webpages—the images, GIFs, videos. It
is important to include media content because it simply makes your content
better. <a href=""https://www.jeffbullas.com/6-powerful-reasons-why-you-should-include-
images-in-your-marketing-infographic/"">Blog posts with images get 94% more
traffic</a> than those without.</p>
<p>Images are also processed <a href=""http://www.t-sciences.com/news/humans-process-visual-data-better"">60,000x faster than
text</a>. The
age-old saying ""a picture is worth a thousand words"" is actually true.</p>
<p>Litter your content with media content to improve readability, and further
breakup the monotony of walls of text.</p>
<p>Some types of media content you can use include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Images</li>
<li>Video</li>
<li>GIFs</li>
<li>Infographics</li>
<li>Interactive Content</li>
</ul>

<p>HTML Markup relates to the elements that make up your web source code. HTML is
a basic coding language that is used to make websites and webpages.</p>
<p>HTML looks like this.</p>
<p><a href=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/8t-1YtqNeQJlpI2LGOLvAB5r7iojSvSZz5I43O0s1IRKcQqzSz0gfzWisYUe1jP1Zdd9-n9jWLsXpdufgwJWUlQP8wmJ1nCDJQUAYKg5XzuuJIK-

vUvfpb2fKK3ywl3NGOGvymGR"" /></a></p>
<p>Before CMS platforms like WordPress and Squarespace made web design easy, it
was left to coders.</p>
<p>Aside from the design of websites and webpages, HTML also tells search engines
what it is. This is important because search engines like Google use that
information to rank webpages in context of things people search for.</p>
<p>You can view the HTML of any page.</p>
<p>Simply right click on any webpage and click “ <strong>View page source</strong> ”.</p>

<h4>Page Titles (Title Tags)</h4>
<p>The page title is the most important place to put a keyword. The page title
tells people and search engines what that webpage is about.</p>

<h4>Meta Description</h4>
<p>The meta description is your webpage SERP blurb. It looks like this.</p>
<p><a href=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lXzXaKGezBNxlbW_mFil7OWQI9c35LB9JeuYGOdz5mSKk9OA_M_wd5U45OXiEBS36XXlbrXtn0eFflJ_roCgq98lJ0Gj4vzo4GsnHzyjM0hOitA5fAQcKF-

<p>It does not directly affect SEO. <a href=""http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/09/google-does-not-
use-keywords-meta-tag.html"">It is not a ranking
factor</a>. Putting a keyword here will not have direct
search engine implications like it would elsewhere.</p>
<p>It does however affect click-through rates.</p>
<p>The meta description acts to entice and persuade search engine users to visit.</p>
<p>A better meta description will have a higher click-through rate, sending more
traffic to your webpage. More traffic will earn you more backlinks, a higher
domain authority, among a host of things.</p>
<p>So it can impact SEO indirectly—which is why it’s important to consider.</p>
<h4>Image Optimization</h4>
<p>Images have their own HTML optimization for on-page seo. We may see the image,
but search engines see the HTML code. The image might always look the same to
us, but depending on the HTML it can be very different to search engines.</p>
<p>You can view the HTML source code for any image. <strong>Right click on the image
and select “Inspect”</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/0-70qfAh7iNUxYYLrbEdYKzZmIjP4kmzSrxqacQckFOSOEJnLreYjCYwyC3Y_vHNbcUiLAzYaCTpO4iNJ2uzadTuNDTXSejVyVaIxJmKM1-qf45lJbThhFpt-0-RmFvazrhUDj_g""><img alt="""" src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/0-70qfAh7iNUxYYLrbEdYKzZmIjP4kmzSrxqacQckFOSOEJnLreYjCYwyC3Y_vHNbcUiLAzYaCTpO4iNJ2uzadTuNDTXSejVyVaIxJmKM1-qf45lJbThhFpt-0-RmFvazrhUDj_g"" /></a>

<p><strong>There are 3 things we must consider for image on-page SEO.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Image Alt-Text</li>
<li>Image Title</li>
<li>Image Filename</li>

<h5>Image Alt-Text</h5>
<p>The image alt-text can also be known as the alt attribute, or alt description.
It is used to tell search engines what an image is about. It also helps those
who can’t view images or have low bandwidth internet connections.</p>
<p>**The alt-text is essentially a long-tail keyword for images.  **</p>
<p>This is important because people can find your website through images. When
people do an image search, they often click through to the website the image
came from.</p>
<p>I found Serp Co through an image search.</p>
<p><a href=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Xwu7DWlWGVQPWMSTzzlRLvkI5RBA2ToS9KP6mWz94nV5m77YpjoEQOCNLM2enw2xyaSnTFL2kV19SZJMhf35TSW1pPX0ohnxDP5S8A1aqwZ8hMcna-W8eHc4tXIYZNpU716a1QJ1""><img alt="""" src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Xwu7DWlWGVQPWMSTzzlRLvkI5RBA2ToS9KP6mWz94nV5m77YpjoEQOCNLM2enw2xyaSnTFL2kV19SZJMhf35TSW1pPX0ohnxDP5S8A1aqwZ8hMcna-W8eHc4tXIYZNpU716a1QJ1"" /></a></p>
<p>A good alt-text can also make an image appear for a larger net of search
queries/terms.</p>

</ul>
<h5>Image Title</h5>
<p>The image title attribute is used to provide additional information. It does
not impact SEO, therefore it is not as important as alt-text or filename.</p>
<p>It is the little pop-up that can appear when you put your cursor on an image.</p>
<p><a href=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hkrQVXRDsG3Mpr7EQbXr0LKiQ7qGjNAy6_RsDd48lYJqIxv-

<h5>Image Filename</h5>
<p>The image filename is the unique name given to images. It is used by search
engines to help rank and index images. Just like alt-text it is important
because image searches are a pathway to your website.</p>

<h4>Geotagging (For Local Related Queries)</h4>
<p>Geotagging is when you attribute a geographical location to a specific webpage
and/or its content. This content can include images and videos for example.</p>
<p>When you geotag an image or video, you are giving search engines very specific
information. It will allow you to appear on SERPs for search queries with a
location.</p>
<p>""Pet stores in Manhattan"" for example.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/09/image-9.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/09/image-9.png"" /></a></p>
<p>When you geotag webpages and content, you are giving search engines more and
more information. The more information you give them, the better.</p>
<p>It is an effective SEO strategy for local related search queries.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Related Reading</strong> : Check out our full article on Local SEO. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Structured Data</h4>
<p>Structured Data are HTML tags you can add that make crawling, indexing and
ranking easier. It improves the way search engines read your webpages,
resulting in better SERP representation.</p>
<p>Utilizing structured data can help content of your webpage show up as SERP
features.</p>
<h5>SERP Features</h5>
<p>SERP features are special results you see on search engine results pages.</p>
<p>Here is an example.</p>
<p><a href=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/INhR162fjL9FVwy_1xmMQtB6sgyrCOV0v5yKCpDQmeD22ZwERG-1jkd9qAdYoNWqyFsfMeZpUBSv04Oo8zSOh9yBDQHQI-
Tfq0jdl9R_0eRu90q2MPvk5kCApHtcuXti2af-xhiI""><img alt="""" src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/INhR162fjL9FVwy_1xmMQtB6sgyrCOV0v5yKCpDQmeD22ZwERG-1jkd9qAdYoNWqyFsfMeZpUBSv04Oo8zSOh9yBDQHQI-
Tfq0jdl9R_0eRu90q2MPvk5kCApHtcuXti2af-
xhiI"" /></a></p>
<p>The incentive of SERP features are that people can get answers to questions
without clicking through. It is priority positioning with unique, additional
information.</p>
<p>Although structured data is not considered a ranking factor, SERP features
generally have higher click-through rates. Much like a good meta description,
this can indirectly affect SEO.</p>
<p><strong>There are many types of SERP features</strong> (with Google creating more almost
daily), but we will cover a few of the main ones:</p>
<h5>Rich Snippets</h5>

<h4>Keyword Density</h4>
<p>Keyword density is the frequency, or how often keywords are used on a single
webpage. This isn’t just how many times a keyword is used, but how often it is
used.</p>
<p><strong>Keyword density = number. of times keyword used ÷ total number of words</strong></p>
<p>Keyword density used to be extremely important for SEO. Because of that, low
quality keyword stuffed content was considered ideal.</p>
<p>That is no longer the case.</p>
<p><a href=""https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2013/08/in-depth-articles-in-search-
results.html"">Google evolved their algorithm in
2013</a>, to punish black hat (illegal) keyword stuffing. They want high
quality content, not cheap tricks to game the system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Keyword density, in general, is something I wouldn’t focus on. Search
engines have kind of moved on from there.</em> "" (2014)</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmu/"">John Meuller</a>, Senior Google Webmaster
Trends Analyst</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As such, keyword density is no longer as important—but it still needs
consideration.</p>

<li><strong>Protocol</strong> : Either HTTP or HTTPs</li>
<li><strong>Domain Name:</strong> The unique purchased domain name</li>
<li><strong>Subdirectories</strong> : Category/group of pages</li>
<li><strong>Specific Page Name</strong> : The specific individual page</li>
</ol>
<p>Some websites (like us) don't show the ""protocol"" HTTP/HTTPs section of the
web address URL. It is purely a marketing/aesthetic decision, even though it
still is technically there.</p>
<p>How you structure your URLs is important because it can impact SEO.</p>
<p>URLs are actually small ranking factors for search engines. Brian Dean of
Backlinko reported <a href=""https://backlinko.com/google-ctr-stats"">URLs featuring a keyword increased click-through rate by
45%</a>.</p>
<p>A good URL structure can also increase user experience, indirectly influencing
SEO. Microsoft discovered that <a href=""https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/10/13/organic-seo-ctr-
infographic"">""descriptive"" URLs had 25% higher click-
through rates</a>.</p>
<p>The URL is something you should not forget to address.</p>

<h4>Internal Links</h4>
<p>Internal linking is the process of hyperlinking from one page to another, on
the same website.</p>
<p>It helps create a better link architecture for Googlebot to crawl and index.
This better spreads link equity across a website, providing substantial SEO
benefits.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href=""https://ninjaoutreach.com/internal-linking-case-study/"">Internal links have been shown to increase organic traffic by
40%</a>.</p>

<h4>External (Outbound) Links</h4>
<p>External links are hyperlinks that go to another website/domain.</p>
<p><strong>There are 2 types of external links.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Ones you receive (inbound/backlinks)</li>
<li>Ones you make (outbound links)</li>
</ol>
<p>Backlinks are considered one of the <a href=""https://searchengineland.com/now-know-googles-top-three-search-
ranking-factors-245882"">top 3 Google ranking
factors</a>. This is not terribly shocking. Anyone with even a
novice understanding of SEO knows this.</p>
<p>What’s more unknown, is the value of outbound links.</p>
<p>Outbound links are not specifically a ranking factor. It can however
indirectly influence SEO by improving user experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Linking to other websites is a great way to provide value to your users.
Often times, links help users to find out more, to check out your sources
and to better understand how your content is relevant to the questions that
they have.” (2019)</p>
<p>John Mueller, Senior Google Webmaster Trends Analyst</p>

<h4>Duplicate Content (Avoid it)</h4>
<p>Duplicate content is content that is a copy, or similar to other content on
the web. This can be either on different sites or the same one.</p>

<p>Here’s <a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66359?hl=en#targetText=Duplicate%20content%20generally%20refers%20to,is%20not%20deceptive%20in%20origin."">Google's definition of duplicate
content</a>.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Duplicate content generally refers to substantive blocks of content within
or across domains that either completely match other content or are
appreciably similar.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Duplicate content can negatively impact SEO.</p>
<p>Google does not want to index duplicate content. They prioritize indexing
original, unique informative content. This is what they want to appear on
SERPs.</p>
<p>It is essential that you avoid creating duplicate content.</p>

If you have a small ""bricks and mortar"" local business, you absolutely NEED a
website.

We live in a world dominated by the internet — a digital world of websites and
webpages. Having a website for your business is not inherently new, but you'd
be surprised how many still don't.

A properly built website is the first (and most foundational) piece of a
successful [local seo](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/) campaign.

You can bet your competitors have ones — why give them any advantage?

## How Does a Website Help My Local Business?

You're probably wondering... ""What is the point of having a website? How does
it help my business?""

If you can boil it down to one thing it's this: nobody uses telephone
directories to find businesses anymore. In fact, [by 2011 only 30% of
Americans still used them](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/03/yellow-
pages-opt-out-website_n_818050.html?ir=Green&ec_carp=3784010169517559402).
Imagine what that statistic is now.

Everything is now done online.

 **If you want your business to be found, you must have a website on the
internet.**

Without one, you'll struggle to keep up with your competitors.

## What Type of Website Do I Need?

You might think you can throw together a cheap website and think that's going
to cut it just because you have been annoyed into oblivion by all those Wix
ads.

Or those ""one page website"" ads that Russel Brunson so clickbait-ily pioneered
to drive more people into his funnel software touting that you only need a
SINGLE page website.

In fact I've even seen people saying you don't need a website at all.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-26.gif)

Well guess what, they are all wrong.

If you have a legitimate local business (where you see customers at your
location or you go to your customers) you need a website. And if you want it
to bring you new customers everyday who want your services, for free, from
organic traffic - it needs to be structured properly for [local
SEO](https://devinschumacher.com//local/).

 **Your website is something that needs _special_ attention. **

You need a website that:

  * Has a homepage that leaves a powerful first impression.
  * Is full of persuasive sales copy that transitions traffic into _leads_.
  * Builds a connection with your prospective customers through high-quality content.
  * Has an effective email marketing funnel strategy.
  * Has an appropriately high conversion rate.
  * Is easy to understand, navigate & use. 
  * Ranks on the 1st page of Google for MULTIPLE terms.
  * Ultimately answers the question ""what's in it for me?"" (me being your prospect).

 **A properly built local business website will grow your business faster than
you can image, with free traffic, that is consistently finding your business
instead of your competitors, who are warmer & more qualified than any leads
coming from outbound advertising.**

## Defining Your Website Goals

Before we get into how to create your website, we need to define some goals.

Define Goals. Work Towards Goals. Accomplish Goals.

It's that simple... Well, it might also require a montage.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-1-3.gif)

 **You need to always remember WHY you're making this website.**

What is the purpose of your website? What is your service, or services? Do you
sell anything online? Whatever your business offers, keep this in mind when
creating your website.

If you're a landscaping business, your website's purpose is to inform and sell
your service, with readily-available contact details.

If you sell candles, your website might be used to sell them online, to a
wider market.

 **It's also important that you keep the customer in mind.**

Who are they, why do they buy your product/service? How does my website look
to them?

If you can define these goals, then you're ready to begin.

## Part 1: Website Essentials

 **To build any website, you'll need 3 essential items.**

  * Domain Name
  * Hosting
  * CMS

## Domain Name

The first thing you'll need for your website, is a domain name.

A domain name is the unique part of your website address ⁠— the ""google"" in
google.com, for example.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-68-1.png)

The domain name technically also includes the "".com"" part as well. This is
because ""google.com"" is not the same as ""google.net"" or ""google.uk."" They are
entirely separate domains.

 **FYI - The "".com"" part of a website address is called the top-level
domain.**

There are a few things you need to know when it comes to your domain name:

  * Where to buy a domain name
  * What should your domain name be
  * How much does a domain name cost

#### Where to buy a domain name

Buying a domain name is usually bundled in when you buy website hosting (this
will be covered shortly.)

We have tried them all, and recommend:

  * [NameCheap](https://devin.to/namecheap)

You CAN buy a domain name separately, but it's really not necessary. Better to
just buy it with hosting.

#### What should your domain name be?

Your domain name is really an extension of your business name.

There are 3 primary types of domain names for local/service based businesses:

  * Branded Domain
  * Keyword Domain
  * [Hybrid Domain](http://Hybrid-Domain-Names)

##  **Branded Domain Names**

A Branded domain is a domain name that is simply the name of your actual
brand/business/company.

 **Example:**

  *  **Brand name** : SERP Co
  *  **Brand meaning** : ""SERP"" an acronym for ""Search Engine Results Page"", aka the list of results you see _everytime you do a search_. We help brands get more traffic from SERPs (and other forms of digital marketing.
  *  **Domain name** : serp.co

This is called a ""Branded"" domain name.

Note that staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloudm, serp.net, serp.org are also
branded domain names - we are only referring to the root domain when we talk
about names, not the ""TLD"".

The 'root' domain is the part before the dot.

The part after the dot is called the ""TLD"", or Top Level Domain, and is the
"".com"", "".net"", "".org"", "".co"", etc. that you are used to seeing.

 **A Branded domain name has the Brand Name in the Domain Name. Duh.**

##  **Keyword Domain Names**

Many local businesses will serve one primary area, and maybe only 1 or a few
services. For example, a landscaping company in Los Angeles, CA.

It it quite common to see the business buy a domain name like
""losangeleslandscapers.com""

This is called Keyword domain. Or an ""Exact Match Domain"" (EMD) because the
domain name exactly matches the main keyword they want to rank for to get more
customers.

This is OKAY to do if your ACTUAL brand name is, in fact, ""Los Angeles
Landscapers"". This would be a ""Branded EMD"".

However, if your brand name was something like James & John Home Services.,
and you really wanted landscaping customers from los angeles, so you made a
domain ""losangeleslandscapers.com"" then this is quite clearly an attempt to
game the system, the system being Google, by tapping into one of the primary
[google ranking factors](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/)
which is domain name.

Having a Keyword domain, when your actual brand name is something different,
will lead to all sorts of [technical
seo](https://devinschumacher.com/technical-seo/) problems for you down the
road if you don't **realllllly** know what you are doing, so we do not
recommend this course of action.

 **A Keyword Domain is a domain name that has the primary keywords that are
important to your business in the name. Duh again.**

##  **Hybrid Domain Names**

A hybrid domain name is just a blend of the Branded & Keyword domain.

Continuing with our landscaper example above it would be something like
jamesandjohnlandscapers.com

In this example, the Brand name was James & John Home Services, but they
wanted more landscaping customers so they put the keyword ""landscapers"" in the
root of the domain.

It can work, but should be handled with care. If you are thinking of doing
something like this, just contact us for and we will give you our 2 cents.

 **A Hybrid Domain is a domain name that mixes the Brand name term with
important keywords terms.**

 _ **Sidenote** : The TLD is also an important choice, but not nearly as
important as the 'root' domain. More commonplace TLDs like "".com"", "".net"",
"".org"", "".co"" tend to be seen as more authentic, and trustworthy. This is
generally going to lead to a higher click-through rate. _

## How much does a domain name cost?

 **There are 2 associated costs when buying a domain:**

  * The initial fee when purchasing it
  * The annual fee for retaining/keeping it

Typically it costs about $10-$12 USD to buy a domain name, and around the same
to keep it for a year.

So the first year it'll cost $20-$24 USD, and $10-$12 every year after that.

As you have to continually renew your domain each year, it will be an on-
going, small expense.

## Hosting

To have a live website, you not only need a domain name, but hosting.

Hosting is basically access to a server that allows your website to be
""online."" I could write out a long technical answer for what a server is, but
it would be a waste of time. All you need to know is this:

 **Hosting = server = allows your website to be seen online by all.**

There are hundreds of popular hosting services, but to be honest most of them
suck. Why? Well one reason is because they are all owned by the same giant
conglomerate called Endurance International Group.

Look them up if you want, but we will save you the time and just let you know
that you have been warned.

Frankly, the most popular hosting solutions are really the worst. This include
GoDaddy, HostGator, etc.

Prices can run from $50/year to as much as $1000+/year, depending on how much
space & speed you need (it's slightly more complex than that but this article
is about website structure so who cares.)

For a local small business, you'd want to go for something that's affordable.
At this point you don't really need a massive server size with world-class
security.

When we got started we used [SiteGround](https://devin.to/siteground), and are
moving a lot of our websites now to a private hosting company that we trust,
called IONBLADE.

It can be a nightmare if you do it wrong, and overall it's gonna be a lot of
technical mumbo jumbo for you to sift through if you don't speak the language
of ""interwebs"".

Whoever you decide to go with, make sure you do good research.

## CMS

You've got your domain name, and your hosting ⁠— there's one essential left: a
CMS.

A CMS (content management system) ⁠is basically a website builder platform.
It's a way for you to control and manage all the files and elements of your
website, for all of us who don't see the matrix.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-2-2.gif)

A good CMS will allow you to create your actual website, and optimize it for
SEO.

 **Here is a list of the most popular Content Management Systems:**

  * [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/)
  * [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/)
  * [Wix](https://www.wix.com/)
  * [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com)
  * [Magnolia](https://www.magnolia-cms.com/)

Although there are various choices, WordPress is by far the most popular (35%
of the internet uses it.) We use it. We recommend it.

## Part 2: Website Functionality

## Features You Will Need

What features does your local business require for its website? What purpose
does your website serve? Is it a place to get information, or is it somewhere
people can buy things online?

 **Regardless of what your local business is, you will need a blog.**

Blogging, sometimes called ""[content
marketing](https://devinschumacher.com/what-is-content-marketing/)"", is a
universal feature for every business website on the internet. It's the prime
way to draw in large amounts of organic traffic from search engines.

Your website needs to be ""found"" and creating content (blogging) is one way to
do it.

If you sell stuff online, you will need ecommerce functionality (called a
shopping cart) and all the requirements that come with it. WordPress plugins
make all of this easy.

## Who Will Build Your Website?

One of the most important questions you must ask is ""who will build my
website?"" This is something that takes time, effort and money. Are you able to
do this yourself? Do you have the free time to do it? Or do you need to hire
someone?

 **If you can't do it yourself, then you have a few ""out-sourcing"" options.**

  * One of your employees with website-building experience (in-house)
  * A web design agency

Whatever outsourcing route you go, you need to make sure they know how to
create a website. Do they understand website structure and its influence on
SEO? Do they know how to optimize branding and design to maximize user
experience?

## Who Will Run Your Website?

Even after your website is created, it needs to be constantly managed. You
have to ask yourself, ""who will run the website?""

There are multiple aspects of your website that need constant ""maintenance.""
Some of these include:

  * Adding new content and pages 
  * Fixing/troubleshooting errors/malware/attacks
  * SEO aspects to facilitate growth
  * Website redesigns when necessary 

The question you need to be asking: ""who will do these tasks?"" Are you able to
do them? Do you have the time, or do you need to hire someone? Is that someone
already an employee of yours, or is it an agency/outsource?

 **KEY POINT —** Websites are not static - they must be managed, maintained,
and over time, grown.

If you want help with your website management including: hosting, security,
updates, uploads, edits & continued support - [SERP Co](http://staging-
devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud) is happy to help.

## Part 3: Planning

Before you even attempt to make your website, you need to outline a plan, a
sitemap, and an idea of the website design you want.

We'll start by going over all the pages your website needs.

### All the Pages Your Local Business Website Needs

If you didn't know, a website is basically just a bunch of pages stuck
together, under one domain. So it makes sense that we cover each page that you
need, one by one.

  * Homepage
  * About page
  * Contact page
  * Blog page
  * Services page
  * Service page (service lander)
  * Locations page
  * Location page (local lander)

#### Homepage

Every website has got a homepage — it's the most essential page.

A homepage should act as a 30,000 foot view of your business - a dashboard in
a sense. It should give a little bit of everything you do to allow a user to
get a broad, but semi-complete, picture of your brand.

**Your homepage should feature:**

  * Who you are, and what you do.
  * The benefits your customers receive from working with you.
  * Your unique value proposition - what sets you apart form your competitors?
  * Pictures of your team, and a sense of your culture/values.
  * Persuasive sales copy to encourage visitors to take an action.
  * Social proof (testimonials/reviews/awards etc).
  * Imagery, videos & other multimedia.
  * A summary of your services.
  * Links to other pages on your website for visitors to explore further

[SERP Co Homepage](https://devinschumacher.com/)

## About page

Your About Page should give visitors a clear view of your brand -the people,
values, mission, and what makes you different.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/about-page-
example-1024x555-1.png)

[SERP Co About Page](https://devinschumacher.com/about/)

Typical URL for an About Page: **site.com/about/**

#### Contact page

Your contact page should provide an easy way for website visitors to get in
touch with you.

This sounds easy, but it is critical. If someone gets all the way to your
contact page and can't easily contact you, you are going to miss out on a huge
amount of revenue.

Trouble contacting someone through a ""Contact Page"" ... sounds ridiculous
right? It is, but you'd be surprised how often this happens.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/contact-example-
page-copy.jpg)

[SERP Co Contact Page](https://devinschumacher.com/contact/)

Typical URL for a Contact Page: **/contact/**

## Blog page

Your blog page will be a hub where all your content/posts are found.

Each time you create a new blog post, it will automatically show up here -
typically with a featured image, the author name, author profile picture, a
date, a text snippet, etc.

![Image result for blog pages](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/2e28749e-a7fa-4d24-a340-b96cbf046a8b.png)

[SERP Co Blog Page](https://devinschumacher.com/)

Typical URL for a Blog Page: **/blog/**

#### Services page

Your services page should list all of the services you offer, with links to
each individual The ""Services"" page is a critical page on your website for 3
reasons:

  1. It tells search engines the services you offer (so they can begin to understand what you do and rank you for them).
  2. It tells customers the services you offer (so they can begin to understand what you do and buy from you).
  3. It links out to each individual service page. We call this a 'link hub'.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/services-page-
example-1024x952-1.png)

[SERP Co Services Page](https://devinschumacher.com/services/)

Typical URL for a Services Page: **/services/**

#### Locations page

If you have multiple locations you will want a page on your website dedicated
to summarizing those locations.

A Locations Page will also act as a link hub.

![Image result for location page](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/8-gude-location.jpg)

Typical URL for a Locations Page: **/locations/**

## Create an SEO Sitemap

An SEO sitemap is basically just a visual representation of how your website
structure looks, page-by-page.

![Image result for sitemap](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/dyno-mapper-sitemap-generator.png)

Your sitemap will give you a blueprint visual to the website you are creating.
It will show you all the pages you need, and how they link together.

 **Remember:** A website is simply a bunch of text files, organized inside a
folder. Many times it will be folders within folders - much like you would
create on your computer. Organization is critical for us humans to remember
where our stuff is, and is also critical for search engine crawlers to more
easily understand where things are on your website.

Either draw your sitemap on a whiteboard/blackboard, or make a document
online. Keep the sitemap visible at all times.

## Part 4: Website Structure

Website structure is basically how all the different pages on your website are
connected together. This image should help you get an idea of what I'm talking
about.

![Image result for website structure](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/sitemap-pyramid.png)source: papaya internet

The structure of your website starts with the homepages, and internal links
connect it to category pages. From there the pages get more and more specific
⁠— this is the basic idea of website structure.

### Why is Website Structure Important?

 **When you boil it right down, there's only really 2 reasons why website
structure is important.**

  1. SEO ⁠— how easy it is for search engines to crawl your website
  2. User experience ⁠— how easy it for people is to use your website

Good website structure makes it easy for both search engines and search users
to navigate your website.

### What is Optimal Website Structure?

The website structures that appear to perform best, are ones that are
""shallow.""

A shallow website structure means that you can get anywhere on the website in
3 clicks or less.

**For a local business website, we most definitely want a shallow website
structure.**

We can breakdown a shallow website structure into 4 basic levels.

![Image result for website structure](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/silo-structure.png)source: wise seo

  * Level 1: The Homepage
  * Level 2: The Category Pages
  * Level 3: The Subcategory Pages
  * Level 4: The Content/Blog Posts

#### Level 1: The Homepage

The first level of your shallow website structure is the homepage. It is the
ground floor, where visitors enter.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-77-1024x480-1.png)

A homepage acts as the central hub ⁠— the directory with signposts to all
places on your website.

**The homepage of a website should be linking to 2 types of pages.**

  * Category pages
  * Important pages on your website

A homepage will start off the structure of a website by linking to category
pages.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-79-2.png)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-78-1024x480-1.png)

Category pages are the second level of a shallow website structure — we'll
cover it shortly.

Please don't get confused by the word ""category"" here. We are not referring to
blog categories. We are simply saying that you need to organize your website's
pages into different categories of page types.

You also want to link important pages, to prioritize the flow of link juice
from the backlinks you acquire. For us, we link to our individual service
pages, and to our blog posts.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-80-1024x480-1.png)

Try not to overdo it with the links from your homepage.

## Level 2: Your ""Category"" Pages

Once again, do not confuse this with blog post categories. We are not talking
about blog categories or tags.

We are talking about the different categories of pages on your website - like
your ""Service Pages"", or ""Local Landers"", etc.

The second level of a shallow website structure are the category pages.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-81-1.png)

These are the key pages featured on your header and footer menus. Examples for
a local business might include:

  * About page
  * Services page
  * Blog page
  * Contact page
  * Locations page

These pages divide the main ""categories"" or content of your website. Unless
you are Amazon or an e-commerce site, you probably wont have more than a few.
Most small local businesses will fall between 5-6.

Each individual page will be different, depending on what type of page it is.
Your about page might not further link deeper, but your services page
_absolutely should_.

As an example, SERP Co's services page leads to individual pages for each
service they offer.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-82-1024x509-1.png)

Page types for local businesses will be covered below.

 **IMPORTANT: These type of category pages are different from e-commerce
category pages. Ecommerce website structure will be covered later.**

#### Level 3: Your ""sub categories""

The third level, subcategory pages, may or may not exist, depending on your
website. Some websites go straight from the category pages to the content,
with no need for ""subcategories.""

A good example of a subcategory page is SERP University splitting into
""Content"" and ""SEO"" modules.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-83-1024x459-1.png)

Each subcategory page houses all the individual posts/blog posts, which is the
fourth level of website structure. The reason is that each of these Primary
Topics are HUGE, and need to be broken down further.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-84-1024x514-1.png)

As you can see above, subcategories may or may not be part of your shallow
website structure. It really just depends on the nature of your business and
website.

#### Level 4: The Content/Blog Posts

Content makes up the fourth, and final level of a shallow website structure.
By content I am referring to the individual posts/blog posts of your website.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-85-1024x480-1.png)

At this level, you are effectively at the end of your website — there are no
more levels beyond this.

The purpose of a websites content is to generate large amount of organic
traffic from search engines. This is typically done targeting long-tail
keywords, discovered through effective keyword research.

## Website Structure for a Local Business Website

Now, website structure for a local business is not going to differ that
dramatically from general website structure. There are however, some
strategies we should talk about — ones specific to local businesses.

  * You need individual pages for each service you offer
  * Support your service pages with the right blog posts

## You need individual pages for each service you offer

If you run a small business, your website absolutely needs individual pages
for every service you offer.

Why should you?

Because Google (and other search engines) rank your pages based on the content
on it. It's easier to rank for ""Newport lawn mowing service"" if you have a
page solely dedicated to it. You're more likely to rank for a keyword if your
meta tags, and page content are targeting it.

This is an approach SERP Co uses — each of the 7 main services have their own
dedicated pages.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-86-2.png)

The pages are extremely detailed, with images, persuasive copy and even
testimonials.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-88-1024x480-1.png)

The strategy is both superior for SEO and user experience.

This is opposed to having one services page for all the services that you
offer. With this strategy you're hurting your ranking potential, for each
individual service.

It's an inaccurate shotgun, versus a highly-targeted sniper rifle.

## Support your service pages with the right blog posts

Now, with individual services pages, you're going to rank well. But that's not
the only thing we can do to improve those pages' rankings.

 **You need around 1-3 high-quality blog posts based around each service that
you offer.**

The key is you want these blog posts to link back to the specific service page
they relate to, using a keyword variation.

So, for example, lets say you created a service page for gutter cleaning
services, and created a blog titled ""how to clean your gutters."" You would
simply place a link from the blog post, to the service page, making sure you
use a keyword variation. A keyword variation example would be, ""gutter
cleaning services in [location].

### Other Things to Know About Website Structure

There are some other more, ""miscellaneous"" items of website structure we
should detail.

  * Breadcrumbs
  * Menus for navigation
  * Keep URL slugs clean and simple
  * CTAs

#### Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs are the small text paths you see at the top of pages. They look
like this.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-72-2.png)

Basically a line of hyperlink texts that tells you how far/many pages you are
from the homepage.

They make it easy for both users and search engines to navigate your website.

 **There are technically multiple types of breadcrumbs.**

There are ones that show how far you are from the homepage (like the example
above.)

![breadcrumbs hierarchy](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/breadcrumbs_bestbuy-600x298-1.png)source: yoast

E-commerce ones that detail all the category attributes you have added to your
store search.

![breadcrumbs attribute](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/breadcrumbs_officedepot-600x316-1.png)

And ones that show your recent history on the website.

![breadcrumbs history](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/breadcrumbs_macys.png)

They all have their place regarding website structure. Just make sure your
website has breadcrumbs — it's an easy way to boost website structure.

## Menus for navigation

 **When it comes to website navigation, there are 2 almost universal features
you must have.**

  * A header menu
  * A footer menu

A header menu is the menu at the top of a website. It looks like this.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-71-1024x480-1.png)

Almost every website made today has one — this is because they make navigation
easy.

I'd recommend making sure that it scrolls down the page with you. There will
be a setting for that in your CMS.

The footer menu is the menu at the very bottom of a page.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-70-1024x480-1.png)

This is also fairly standard practice. It seems to help navigation, while not
being intrusive.

Make sure your local business website has these two menus.

#### Keep URL slugs clean and simple

Another aspect of website structure, is the URL slugs of each page.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-90.png)

Each page has its own unique URL slug — from the category pages, to the
subcategories and the posts. Technically the homepage has no slug I guess...
It's the homepage — it needs no slug.

URL slugs can be simple like the example above, or more complex — indicating
you are further down a website.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-91-2.png)

Having clean, easy to understand URL slugs helps both search engines and users
navigate the depths of your website.

**Try to keep it short, use hyphens to separate words, and use a keyword if it
contextually makes sense.**

## CTAs

Call to actions (CTA) are buttons on a website that typically lead to a
landing page, or something of importance.

![Image result for call to action](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/call-to-action20examples20skimm.jpg)

It's important to note that opt-in forms and CTAs are not exactly the same
thing. The call to action is the button ON an opt-in form.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-73-2.png)

A CTA can be used in many different ways/contexts. Examples include:

  * Pop-ups
  * Header menus
  * Sidebars
  * At the bottom of blog posts/content

Regarding good website structure, call to actions act as a way to lead users
to important pages/places.

Make sure you try to make them ""un-intrusive."" If you are using a pop-up with
a CTA for example, use an exit-intent one.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-75-1024x571-1.png)

Using a bright, contrasting button color can help grab attention, leading to
more clicks.

![Image result for call to action color](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/main-qimg-7bf50175ac8c4bf159ec59caa4dda41f.webp)

You can also attach a ""lead magnet"" to your call to actions. A lead magnet is
something of value, like an eBook, report, or cheat-sheet.

![Image result for types of lead magnets](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

## Part 5: Branding & Design

With structure out of the way, the last element to your local business website
is branding and design.

Before we get into things, we should _define_ what website _branding_ and
_design_ are.

### What is Website Branding and Design?

Website design is the visual appearance of your website — it's the tone and
feel it creates. This includes everything from your website color scheme, logo
and page layout.

As a local business, you need a website that makes a strong, professional, yet
unique impression. It needs to be appropriate based on your industry and
country of business. This is all crucial to building consumer trust and
confidence.

### Effective Branding/Design Strategies

There are a number of different branding & design strategies you need to
implement.

  * Responsive design
  * Consistent design and color scheme
  * Header and footer menus
  * Logo on top header bar
  * Phone number on top header bar
  * SSL certificate (HTTPS)
  * Social proof

 **NOTE: most of these things come with website templates automatically. It
does help to actually know _why_ you need them however.**

#### Responsive design

This is, the, most important website design strategy — one you **MUST**
implement.

A responsive design is basically a function that allows your website to change
its size/proportions, based on the device used.

Regardless of what device someone has, they can use your website. Mobile,
laptop, desktop, tablet... It doesn't matter. Your website adapts.

In a world of smartphones dominating internet usage, this is absolutely vital.

Your CMS should come with responsive design function for your website — it's a
standard feature these days. Pretty much all WordPress themes come with it.

#### Consistent design and color scheme

Each and every page of your website needs to have a consistent design and
color scheme. Look at how every SERP Co page has the same color and font.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-95-1024x223-1.png)

Each page is going to have its own unique page layout — this depends on page
type (homepage/about/services/contact etc.)

Make sure that each and every page on your website has the same font and color
scheme. This will make your website look professional, and your business
authentic.

#### Header and footer menus

This was covered in website structure, but it's also a design element, so I'll
rehash here.

Header and footer menus are universal design features that all websites have.

![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is
image-71-1024x480.png](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-71-1024x480-1.png)

![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is
image-70-1024x480.png](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-70-1024x480-1.png)

You can add these menus to your website with your CMS platform.

#### Logo on top header bar

Your business logo should feature on your top header bar — the top corner,
adjacent your header menu works well.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-92-1024x480-1.png)

This can be done through your CMS platform.

#### Phone number on top header bar

As a local business, you'll want your phone number on your top header bar,
along with your business logo and header menu.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-93-2.png)

This makes it easy for your website visitors to contact you.

Also done through your CMS.

#### SSL certificate (HTTPS)

Even if you're not selling anything online, you still should have a SSL
certificate.

  *  **Recommended Reading** : [HTTP vs. HTTPS](https://devinschumacher.com/http-vs-https/)

A SSL certificate is basically an extra-level of security for your website —
this is never a bad thing.

![Image result for ssl certificate](https://cdn.pixelprivacy.com/wp-
content/uploads/2018/05/SSL-Example.png)

But why we really want it, is because Google ranks websites with it, better.
It also instills trust and comfort in people who visit your website.

 **NOTE: If you are an ecommerce website, then a SSL certificate is a MUST.**

#### Social proof

You need to make sure your website is littered with ""social proof.""

Social proof is basically things that suggest, show or imply your social
status. It's a way to show your credentials, competency and success. It
influences what people say, do or think.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-94-2.png)

There are many ways we can use social proof for a local business website. Some
methods include:

  * Customer testimonials
  * Reviews
  * ""Who we've worked with"" panels
  * Case studies
  * Awards/accreditation 

Here's an example of some customer testimonials — complete with pictures and
quotes.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2020-03-06-at-12.42.03-pm-1024x468-1.png)

And here's a ""who we've worked with"" panel variation.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2020-03-06-at-12.41.00-pm-1024x273-1.png)

As a local small business, you need to persuade potential customers that you
are the best choice. Littering your website with lots of social proof is key.

## Part 6: Performance

Even after creating your website, your job is not done. When it comes to
websites, the job is never done. You need to be consistently monitoring the
performance of your domain. Below I will show you what you need to monitor,
and how.

 **There are 4 main aspects of performance we will address.**

  * Page Speed
  * Mobile Optimization
  * XML Sitemap
  * Analytics

### Page Speed

How fast the pages of your website load is vitally important. Did you know
bounce rate skyrockets when page speed increases? It's common sense, but take
a look at this.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-80.png)

[Research from Google](https://www.link-assistant.com/news/mobile-
seo-2018.html) — a page taking an extra 5 seconds to load increases bounce
rate by 106%.

FYI — for those of you who don't know, bounce rate is people leaving you
website... So it's not good. At all.

So how can we address, and optimize the speed of our website?

 **Follow these best practices and strategies.**

  * Find out what your websites page speed is
  * Use a CDN
  * Use caching
  * Compress your images

#### Find out what your websites page speed is

First thing we need to do is to discover whether our website is actually slow
or not.

We'll do this with [Google PageSpeed
Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/).

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-96-1024x505-1.png)

Google Pagespeed Insights is a performance test of your website — it's
completely free to use. The test can be run for both desktop and mobile
versions of a website.

After entering your websites URL, you'll get an analysis of your website page
speed. Most of it is overly technical — focus on the rating at the top.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-97-1024x485-1.png)

A 57/100 rating is mediocre — this means we can improve.

 **BONUS: There is a suggestions panel of things you can do to boost page
speed.**

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-98.png)

With this analysis, you should have a clear idea about the speed of your
website.

#### Use a CDN

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a type of network that utilizes
geographical location to effectively connect a user to a webpage. It basically
just reduces the distance between the two.

 **What's important is that a CDN can decrease page loading times.**

Take this case study for example — UK based company [Venture Harbour improved
website speed by 30.2%](https://www.ventureharbour.com/content-delivery-
network/#comparison).

Here's a ""before photo"" speed test.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-97.png)

And here's after.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-98.png)

They said this only took 20 minutes to achieve this result. Talk about bang
for your buck.

#### Use caching

Caching is a function that allows visitors to temporarily ""remember"" aspects
of a website. There is a temporary memory storage that allows the website to
be loaded faster when revisited.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-96.png)

Caching is an easy way to decrease page loading times for your repeat
visitors.

The easiest way to add caching to your website is with a WordPress plugin. [W3
Total Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/) is the most
popular choice.

https://youtu.be/7AsNSSrZq4Y

#### Compress your images

Compressing your images is when you convert an image to a more optimal format
— one with a smaller file size.

**The result is easier-to-load images, making page speed faster.**

It doesn't change the visual appearance of an image either.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-95.png)

You can use [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to compress your images.

This might not seem like it'd do much, but consider how many images you have
on your website.

### Mobile Optimization

We briefly touched on mobile optimization in website design, but we'll go more
in-depth here. I'll explain why you need need it, and how to check everything
is running smoothly.

 **FYI — mobile optimization is easily achieved by using a responsive web
design. Refer to ""Part 4: Branding & Design.""**

The need for mobile optimization came into play with the advent of the
smartphone — around the start of the 2010's.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-76.png)

With the smartphone being the dominant ""system"" it's only natural that
majority of internet usage is done through it. We even have statistics to
prove this.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-77.png)

We live in a mobile-dominated internet age. Google even switched its search
index to ""mobile-first.""

So that's _why_ you need mobile optimization.

Performance-wise, we can use [Google's Mobile-Friendly Test
tool](//search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly) to see where we stand.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-100-1024x504-1.png)

It should give you a clear idea about whether your page is properly optimized
for smartphones.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-101-1024x440-1.png)

Individually run through and test every page on your website — if it's good
for Google, it's good enough.

### XML Sitemap

Ideally you want all pages of your website crawled by search engines,
particularly important ones. This doesn't always happen — in these instances,
a XML sitemap can be valuable.

A XML Sitemap is basically a map that tells Google (and others) the location
of important pages on your website. It's your way of communicating, making
sure your best pages are crawled. It can also be used for images, videos and
other files besides webpages.

Here's how it looks — it's text file with lots of code.

![Image result for xml sitemap example](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/xml-sitemap-example-how-to-setup-xml-

Looks overly technical but they are easy to make — we'll cover it in a second.

You're probably wondering if you actually need a XML sitemap... [According to
Google](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/156184?hl=en&ref_topic=4581190),
if your website is:

  * New
  * Large
  * Has a lot of videos or images
  * Lots of pages poorly linked

Then you should have one.

#### How to create a XML sitemap

The easiest way to create a XML sitemap is to use the [WordPress SEO plugin
Yoast](https://en-au.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/).

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-102-2.png)

To find the XML sitemap function, you'll want to go **SEO > General**

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-103-2.png)

Click on the ""Features"" panel — you'll see the option for XML sitemaps below.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-104-2.png)

When activated, you can press the little question mark and see your XML
sitemap live.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-105-2.png)

#### Use Google Search Console to submit your XML sitemap

Google can find your XML sitemap on its own, but why not just give it to them?
[Google Search Console](//search.google.com/search-console/welcome) allows you
to do this.

There should be a ""Sitemaps"" option on the sidebar.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-search-
console_sitemaps.png)

Add your XML sitemap URL to both boxes.

![Google Search Console Add New Sitemap](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/google-search-console_sitemaps_add-new.png)

The first one (site property) only needs the tail of your URL. The other one
(domain property) will need your entire URL, domain included.

### Analytics

Having some form of analytics is crucial for addressing website performance.

 **FYI** **— Analytics is basically the analysis of statistics, to forecast
future outcomes. It gives us insight to what's working, what's not, and
necessary changes needed to be made.**

There are many options for analytics — we'll be using [Google
Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/)

#### Setting up Google Analytics

Setting up Google Analytics for your website is easy — go to the signup page
and enter in your details.

![Sign in with your Google account](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/signinwithga.png)

If you already have a Google account, you'll just log in with that.

You'll then be asked to give your website information.

![Provide website details](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/gasetup-4.jpg)

Once that's done you'll then have to accept their terms and service, and your
Google Analytics account will be created.

#### Statistics to look out for

Google Analytics gives you 5 different types of analytical reports, each with
unique statistics. These 5 reports are:

  *  **Real-time** — Shows a ""live"" view of your website's traffic
  *  **Audience** — Shows research about your website visitors
  *  **Acquisition** — Shows how and where your website visitors come from
  *  **Behavior** — Shows how website visitors act/behave on your domain
  *  **Conversion** — Shows your success based on specified goals

As a small local business you should focus on **organic traffic** , which is a
measure of how many website visitors you get on your website/pages. You can
find this under the ""Audience"" report/tab, clicking on overview and adding a
new segment.

## Final Thoughts

In this post we covered everything you need to know to create your local
business website.

A website is an essential component to running any sort of business,
especially a local one. Without one, you risk giving your competition the
upper hand.

To learn more about SEO, continue reading the guides in our learning hub, and
join our mastermind community group here: [SERP
University](http://serpuniversity.com/).","<h2>Websites for Local Businesses</h2>
<p>If you have a small ""bricks and mortar"" local business, you absolutely NEED a
website.</p>
<p>We live in a world dominated by the internet — a digital world of websites and
webpages. Having a website for your business is not inherently new, but you'd
be surprised how many still don't.</p>
<p>A properly built website is the first (and most foundational) piece of a
successful <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/"">local seo</a> campaign.</p>
<p>You can bet your competitors have ones — why give them any advantage?</p>
<h2>How Does a Website Help My Local Business?</h2>
<p>You're probably wondering... ""What is the point of having a website? How does
it help my business?""</p>
<p>If you can boil it down to one thing it's this: nobody uses telephone
directories to find businesses anymore. In fact, <a href=""https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/03/yellow-
pages-opt-out-website_n_818050.html?ir=Green&amp;ec_carp=3784010169517559402"">by 2011 only 30% of
Americans still used them</a>.
Imagine what that statistic is now.</p>
<p>Everything is now done online.</p>
<p><strong>If you want your business to be found, you must have a website on the
internet.</strong></p>
<p>Without one, you'll struggle to keep up with your competitors.</p>
<h2>What Type of Website Do I Need?</h2>
<p>You might think you can throw together a cheap website and think that's going
to cut it just because you have been annoyed into oblivion by all those Wix
ads.</p>
<p>Or those ""one page website"" ads that Russel Brunson so clickbait-ily pioneered
to drive more people into his funnel software touting that you only need a
SINGLE page website.</p>
<p>In fact I've even seen people saying you don't need a website at all.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-26.gif"" /></p>
<p>Well guess what, they are all wrong.</p>
<p>If you have a legitimate local business (where you see customers at your
location or you go to your customers) you need a website. And if you want it
to bring you new customers everyday who want your services, for free, from
organic traffic - it needs to be structured properly for <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com//local/"">local
SEO</a>.</p>
<p>**Your website is something that needs <em>special</em> attention. **</p>
<p>You need a website that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has a homepage that leaves a powerful first impression.</li>
<li>Is full of persuasive sales copy that transitions traffic into <em>leads</em>.</li>
<li>Builds a connection with your prospective customers through high-quality content.</li>
<li>Has an effective email marketing funnel strategy.</li>
<li>Has an appropriately high conversion rate.</li>
<li>Is easy to understand, navigate &amp; use. </li>
<li>Ranks on the 1st page of Google for MULTIPLE terms.</li>
<li>Ultimately answers the question ""what's in it for me?"" (me being your prospect).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A properly built local business website will grow your business faster than
you can image, with free traffic, that is consistently finding your business
instead of your competitors, who are warmer &amp; more qualified than any leads
coming from outbound advertising.</strong></p>
<h2>Defining Your Website Goals</h2>
<p>Before we get into how to create your website, we need to define some goals.</p>
<p>Define Goals. Work Towards Goals. Accomplish Goals.</p>
<p>It's that simple... Well, it might also require a montage.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-1-3.gif"" /></p>
<p><strong>You need to always remember WHY you're making this website.</strong></p>
<p>What is the purpose of your website? What is your service, or services? Do you
sell anything online? Whatever your business offers, keep this in mind when
creating your website.</p>
<p>If you're a landscaping business, your website's purpose is to inform and sell
your service, with readily-available contact details.</p>
<p>If you sell candles, your website might be used to sell them online, to a
wider market.</p>
<p><strong>It's also important that you keep the customer in mind.</strong></p>
<p>Who are they, why do they buy your product/service? How does my website look
to them?</p>
<p>If you can define these goals, then you're ready to begin.</p>
<h2>Part 1: Website Essentials</h2>
<p><strong>To build any website, you'll need 3 essential items.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Domain Name</li>
<li>Hosting</li>
<li>CMS</li>
</ul>
<h2>Domain Name</h2>
<p>The first thing you'll need for your website, is a domain name.</p>
<p>A domain name is the unique part of your website address ⁠— the ""google"" in
google.com, for example.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-68-1.png"" /></p>
<p>The domain name technically also includes the "".com"" part as well. This is
because ""google.com"" is not the same as ""google.net"" or ""google.uk."" They are
entirely separate domains.</p>
<p><strong>FYI - The "".com"" part of a website address is called the top-level
domain.</strong></p>
<p>There are a few things you need to know when it comes to your domain name:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where to buy a domain name</li>
<li>What should your domain name be</li>
<li>How much does a domain name cost</li>
</ul>
<h4>Where to buy a domain name</h4>
<p>Buying a domain name is usually bundled in when you buy website hosting (this
will be covered shortly.)</p>
<p>We have tried them all, and recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://devin.to/namecheap"">NameCheap</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You CAN buy a domain name separately, but it's really not necessary. Better to
just buy it with hosting.</p>
<h4>What should your domain name be?</h4>
<p>Your domain name is really an extension of your business name.</p>
<p>There are 3 primary types of domain names for local/service based businesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Branded Domain</li>
<li>Keyword Domain</li>
<li><a href=""http://Hybrid-Domain-Names"">Hybrid Domain</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Branded Domain Names</strong></h2>
<p>A Branded domain is a domain name that is simply the name of your actual
brand/business/company.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brand name</strong> : SERP Co</li>
<li><strong>Brand meaning</strong> : ""SERP"" an acronym for ""Search Engine Results Page"", aka the list of results you see <em>everytime you do a search</em>. We help brands get more traffic from SERPs (and other forms of digital marketing.</li>
<li><strong>Domain name</strong> : serp.co</li>
</ul>
<p>This is called a ""Branded"" domain name.</p>
<p>Note that staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloudm, serp.net, serp.org are also
branded domain names - we are only referring to the root domain when we talk
about names, not the ""TLD"".</p>
<p>The 'root' domain is the part before the dot.</p>
<p>The part after the dot is called the ""TLD"", or Top Level Domain, and is the
"".com"", "".net"", "".org"", "".co"", etc. that you are used to seeing.</p>
<p><strong>A Branded domain name has the Brand Name in the Domain Name. Duh.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Keyword Domain Names</strong></h2>
<p>Many local businesses will serve one primary area, and maybe only 1 or a few
services. For example, a landscaping company in Los Angeles, CA.</p>
<p>It it quite common to see the business buy a domain name like
""losangeleslandscapers.com""</p>
<p>This is called Keyword domain. Or an ""Exact Match Domain"" (EMD) because the
domain name exactly matches the main keyword they want to rank for to get more
customers.</p>
<p>This is OKAY to do if your ACTUAL brand name is, in fact, ""Los Angeles
Landscapers"". This would be a ""Branded EMD"".</p>
<p>However, if your brand name was something like James &amp; John Home Services.,
and you really wanted landscaping customers from los angeles, so you made a
domain ""losangeleslandscapers.com"" then this is quite clearly an attempt to
game the system, the system being Google, by tapping into one of the primary
<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/"">google ranking factors</a>
which is domain name.</p>
<p>Having a Keyword domain, when your actual brand name is something different,
will lead to all sorts of <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/technical-seo/"">technical
seo</a> problems for you down the
road if you don't <strong>realllllly</strong> know what you are doing, so we do not
recommend this course of action.</p>
<p><strong>A Keyword Domain is a domain name that has the primary keywords that are
important to your business in the name. Duh again.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Hybrid Domain Names</strong></h2>
<p>A hybrid domain name is just a blend of the Branded &amp; Keyword domain.</p>
<p>Continuing with our landscaper example above it would be something like
jamesandjohnlandscapers.com</p>
<p>In this example, the Brand name was James &amp; John Home Services, but they
wanted more landscaping customers so they put the keyword ""landscapers"" in the
root of the domain.</p>
<p>It can work, but should be handled with care. If you are thinking of doing
something like this, just contact us for and we will give you our 2 cents.</p>
<p><strong>A Hybrid Domain is a domain name that mixes the Brand name term with
important keywords terms.</strong></p>
<p>_ <strong>Sidenote</strong> : The TLD is also an important choice, but not nearly as
important as the 'root' domain. More commonplace TLDs like "".com"", "".net"",
"".org"", "".co"" tend to be seen as more authentic, and trustworthy. This is
generally going to lead to a higher click-through rate. _</p>
<h2>How much does a domain name cost?</h2>
<p><strong>There are 2 associated costs when buying a domain:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The initial fee when purchasing it</li>
<li>The annual fee for retaining/keeping it</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically it costs about $10-$12 USD to buy a domain name, and around the same
to keep it for a year.</p>
<p>So the first year it'll cost $20-$24 USD, and $10-$12 every year after that.</p>
<p>As you have to continually renew your domain each year, it will be an on-
going, small expense.</p>
<h2>Hosting</h2>
<p>To have a live website, you not only need a domain name, but hosting.</p>
<p>Hosting is basically access to a server that allows your website to be
""online."" I could write out a long technical answer for what a server is, but
it would be a waste of time. All you need to know is this:</p>
<p><strong>Hosting = server = allows your website to be seen online by all.</strong></p>
<p>There are hundreds of popular hosting services, but to be honest most of them
suck. Why? Well one reason is because they are all owned by the same giant
conglomerate called Endurance International Group.</p>
<p>Look them up if you want, but we will save you the time and just let you know
that you have been warned.</p>
<p>Frankly, the most popular hosting solutions are really the worst. This include
GoDaddy, HostGator, etc.</p>
<p>Prices can run from $50/year to as much as $1000+/year, depending on how much
space &amp; speed you need (it's slightly more complex than that but this article
is about website structure so who cares.)</p>
<p>For a local small business, you'd want to go for something that's affordable.
At this point you don't really need a massive server size with world-class
security.</p>
<p>When we got started we used <a href=""https://devin.to/siteground"">SiteGround</a>, and are
moving a lot of our websites now to a private hosting company that we trust,
called IONBLADE.</p>
<p>It can be a nightmare if you do it wrong, and overall it's gonna be a lot of
technical mumbo jumbo for you to sift through if you don't speak the language
of ""interwebs"".</p>
<p>Whoever you decide to go with, make sure you do good research.</p>
<h2>CMS</h2>
<p>You've got your domain name, and your hosting ⁠— there's one essential left: a
CMS.</p>
<p>A CMS (content management system) ⁠is basically a website builder platform.
It's a way for you to control and manage all the files and elements of your
website, for all of us who don't see the matrix.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-2-2.gif"" /></p>
<p>A good CMS will allow you to create your actual website, and optimize it for
SEO.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a list of the most popular Content Management Systems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://wordpress.com/"">WordPress</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://www.squarespace.com/"">Squarespace</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://www.wix.com/"">Wix</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://www.weebly.com"">Weebly</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://www.magnolia-cms.com/"">Magnolia</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Although there are various choices, WordPress is by far the most popular (35%
of the internet uses it.) We use it. We recommend it.</p>
<h2>Part 2: Website Functionality</h2>
<h2>Features You Will Need</h2>
<p>What features does your local business require for its website? What purpose
does your website serve? Is it a place to get information, or is it somewhere
people can buy things online?</p>
<p><strong>Regardless of what your local business is, you will need a blog.</strong></p>
<p>Blogging, sometimes called ""<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/what-is-content-marketing/"">content
marketing</a>"", is a
universal feature for every business website on the internet. It's the prime
way to draw in large amounts of organic traffic from search engines.</p>
<p>Your website needs to be ""found"" and creating content (blogging) is one way to
do it.</p>
<p>If you sell stuff online, you will need ecommerce functionality (called a
shopping cart) and all the requirements that come with it. WordPress plugins
make all of this easy.</p>
<h2>Who Will Build Your Website?</h2>
<p>One of the most important questions you must ask is ""who will build my
website?"" This is something that takes time, effort and money. Are you able to
do this yourself? Do you have the free time to do it? Or do you need to hire
someone?</p>
<p><strong>If you can't do it yourself, then you have a few ""out-sourcing"" options.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One of your employees with website-building experience (in-house)</li>
<li>A web design agency</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever outsourcing route you go, you need to make sure they know how to
create a website. Do they understand website structure and its influence on
SEO? Do they know how to optimize branding and design to maximize user
experience?</p>
<h2>Who Will Run Your Website?</h2>
<p>Even after your website is created, it needs to be constantly managed. You
have to ask yourself, ""who will run the website?""</p>
<p>There are multiple aspects of your website that need constant ""maintenance.""
Some of these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding new content and pages </li>
<li>Fixing/troubleshooting errors/malware/attacks</li>
<li>SEO aspects to facilitate growth</li>
<li>Website redesigns when necessary </li>
</ul>
<p>The question you need to be asking: ""who will do these tasks?"" Are you able to
do them? Do you have the time, or do you need to hire someone? Is that someone
already an employee of yours, or is it an agency/outsource?</p>
<p><strong>KEY POINT —</strong> Websites are not static - they must be managed, maintained,
and over time, grown.</p>
<p>If you want help with your website management including: hosting, security,
updates, uploads, edits &amp; continued support - <a href=""http://staging-
devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud"">SERP Co</a> is happy to help.</p>
<h2>Part 3: Planning</h2>
<p>Before you even attempt to make your website, you need to outline a plan, a
sitemap, and an idea of the website design you want.</p>
<p>We'll start by going over all the pages your website needs.</p>
<h3>All the Pages Your Local Business Website Needs</h3>
<p>If you didn't know, a website is basically just a bunch of pages stuck
together, under one domain. So it makes sense that we cover each page that you
need, one by one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Homepage</li>
<li>About page</li>
<li>Contact page</li>
<li>Blog page</li>
<li>Services page</li>
<li>Service page (service lander)</li>
<li>Locations page</li>
<li>Location page (local lander)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Homepage</h4>
<p>Every website has got a homepage — it's the most essential page.</p>
<p>A homepage should act as a 30,000 foot view of your business - a dashboard in
a sense. It should give a little bit of everything you do to allow a user to
get a broad, but semi-complete, picture of your brand.</p>
<p><strong>Your homepage should feature:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Who you are, and what you do.</li>
<li>The benefits your customers receive from working with you.</li>
<li>Your unique value proposition - what sets you apart form your competitors?</li>
<li>Pictures of your team, and a sense of your culture/values.</li>
<li>Persuasive sales copy to encourage visitors to take an action.</li>
<li>Social proof (testimonials/reviews/awards etc).</li>
<li>Imagery, videos &amp; other multimedia.</li>
<li>A summary of your services.</li>
<li>Links to other pages on your website for visitors to explore further</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/example-of-the-
homepage-1024x575-1.png"" /></p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/"">SERP Co Homepage</a></p>
<h2>About page</h2>
<p>Your About Page should give visitors a clear view of your brand -the people,
values, mission, and what makes you different.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/about-page-
example-1024x555-1.png"" /></p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/about/"">SERP Co About Page</a></p>
<p>Typical URL for an About Page: <strong>site.com/about/</strong></p>
<h4>Contact page</h4>
<p>Your contact page should provide an easy way for website visitors to get in
touch with you.</p>
<p>This sounds easy, but it is critical. If someone gets all the way to your
contact page and can't easily contact you, you are going to miss out on a huge
amount of revenue.</p>
<p>Trouble contacting someone through a ""Contact Page"" ... sounds ridiculous
right? It is, but you'd be surprised how often this happens.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/contact-example-
page-copy.jpg"" /></p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/contact/"">SERP Co Contact Page</a></p>
<p>Typical URL for a Contact Page: <strong>/contact/</strong></p>
<h2>Blog page</h2>
<p>Your blog page will be a hub where all your content/posts are found.</p>
<p>Each time you create a new blog post, it will automatically show up here -
typically with a featured image, the author name, author profile picture, a
date, a text snippet, etc.</p>
<p><img alt=""Image result for blog pages"" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/2e28749e-a7fa-4d24-a340-b96cbf046a8b.png"" /></p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/"">SERP Co Blog Page</a></p>
<p>Typical URL for a Blog Page: <strong>/blog/</strong></p>
<h4>Services page</h4>
<p>Your services page should list all of the services you offer, with links to
each individual The ""Services"" page is a critical page on your website for 3
reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It tells search engines the services you offer (so they can begin to understand what you do and rank you for them).</li>
<li>It tells customers the services you offer (so they can begin to understand what you do and buy from you).</li>
<li>It links out to each individual service page. We call this a 'link hub'.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/services-page-
example-1024x952-1.png"" /></p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/services/"">SERP Co Services Page</a></p>
<p>Typical URL for a Services Page: <strong>/services/</strong></p>
<h4>Locations page</h4>
<p>If you have multiple locations you will want a page on your website dedicated
to summarizing those locations.</p>
<p>A Locations Page will also act as a link hub.</p>
<p><img alt=""Image result for location page"" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/8-gude-location.jpg"" /></p>
<p>Typical URL for a Locations Page: <strong>/locations/</strong></p>
<h2>Create an SEO Sitemap</h2>
<p>An SEO sitemap is basically just a visual representation of how your website
structure looks, page-by-page.</p>
<p><img alt=""Image result for sitemap"" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/dyno-mapper-sitemap-generator.png"" /></p>
<p>Your sitemap will give you a blueprint visual to the website you are creating.
It will show you all the pages you need, and how they link together.</p>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> A website is simply a bunch of text files, organized inside a
folder. Many times it will be folders within folders - much like you would
create on your computer. Organization is critical for us humans to remember
where our stuff is, and is also critical for search engine crawlers to more
easily understand where things are on your website.</p>
<p>Either draw your sitemap on a whiteboard/blackboard, or make a document
online. Keep the sitemap visible at all times.</p>
<h2>Part 4: Website Structure</h2>
<p>Website structure is basically how all the different pages on your website are
connected together. This image should help you get an idea of what I'm talking
about.</p>
<p><img alt=""Image result for website structure"" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/sitemap-pyramid.png"" />source: papaya internet</p>
<p>The structure of your website starts with the homepages, and internal links
connect it to category pages. From there the pages get more and more specific
⁠— this is the basic idea of website structure.</p>
<h3>Why is Website Structure Important?</h3>
<p><strong>When you boil it right down, there's only really 2 reasons why website
structure is important.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>SEO ⁠— how easy it is for search engines to crawl your website</li>
<li>User experience ⁠— how easy it for people is to use your website</li>
</ol>
<p>Good website structure makes it easy for both search engines and search users
to navigate your website.</p>
<h3>What is Optimal Website Structure?</h3>
<p>The website structures that appear to perform best, are ones that are
""shallow.""</p>
<p>A shallow website structure means that you can get anywhere on the website in
3 clicks or less.</p>
<p><strong>For a local business website, we most definitely want a shallow website
structure.</strong></p>
<p>We can breakdown a shallow website structure into 4 basic levels.</p>
<p><img alt=""Image result for website structure"" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/silo-structure.png"" />source: wise seo</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1: The Homepage</li>
<li>Level 2: The Category Pages</li>
<li>Level 3: The Subcategory Pages</li>
<li>Level 4: The Content/Blog Posts</li>
</ul>
<h4>Level 1: The Homepage</h4>
<p>The first level of your shallow website structure is the homepage. It is the
ground floor, where visitors enter.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-77-1024x480-1.png"" /></p>
<p>A homepage acts as the central hub ⁠— the directory with signposts to all
places on your website.</p>
<p><strong>The homepage of a website should be linking to 2 types of pages.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Category pages</li>
<li>Important pages on your website</li>
</ul>
<p>A homepage will start off the structure of a website by linking to category
pages.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-79-2.png"" /></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-78-1024x480-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Category pages are the second level of a shallow website structure — we'll
cover it shortly.</p>
<p>Please don't get confused by the word ""category"" here. We are not referring to
blog categories. We are simply saying that you need to organize your website's
pages into different categories of page types.</p>
<p>You also want to link important pages, to prioritize the flow of link juice
from the backlinks you acquire. For us, we link to our individual service
pages, and to our blog posts.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-80-1024x480-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Try not to overdo it with the links from your homepage.</p>
<h2>Level 2: Your ""Category"" Pages</h2>
<p>Once again, do not confuse this with blog post categories. We are not talking
about blog categories or tags.</p>
<p>We are talking about the different categories of pages on your website - like
your ""Service Pages"", or ""Local Landers"", etc.</p>
<p>The second level of a shallow website structure are the category pages.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-81-1.png"" /></p>
<p>These are the key pages featured on your header and footer menus. Examples for
a local business might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>About page</li>
<li>Services page</li>
<li>Blog page</li>
<li>Contact page</li>
<li>Locations page</li>
</ul>
<p>These pages divide the main ""categories"" or content of your website. Unless
you are Amazon or an e-commerce site, you probably wont have more than a few.
Most small local businesses will fall between 5-6.</p>
<p>Each individual page will be different, depending on what type of page it is.
Your about page might not further link deeper, but your services page
<em>absolutely should</em>.</p>
<p>As an example, SERP Co's services page leads to individual pages for each
service they offer.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-82-1024x509-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Page types for local businesses will be covered below.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: These type of category pages are different from e-commerce
category pages. Ecommerce website structure will be covered later.</strong></p>
<h4>Level 3: Your ""sub categories""</h4>
<p>The third level, subcategory pages, may or may not exist, depending on your
website. Some websites go straight from the category pages to the content,
with no need for ""subcategories.""</p>
<p>A good example of a subcategory page is SERP University splitting into
""Content"" and ""SEO"" modules.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-83-1024x459-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Each subcategory page houses all the individual posts/blog posts, which is the
fourth level of website structure. The reason is that each of these Primary
Topics are HUGE, and need to be broken down further.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-84-1024x514-1.png"" /></p>
<p>As you can see above, subcategories may or may not be part of your shallow
website structure. It really just depends on the nature of your business and
website.</p>
<h4>Level 4: The Content/Blog Posts</h4>
<p>Content makes up the fourth, and final level of a shallow website structure.
By content I am referring to the individual posts/blog posts of your website.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-85-1024x480-1.png"" /></p>
<p>At this level, you are effectively at the end of your website — there are no
more levels beyond this.</p>
<p>The purpose of a websites content is to generate large amount of organic
traffic from search engines. This is typically done targeting long-tail
keywords, discovered through effective keyword research.</p>
<h2>Website Structure for a Local Business Website</h2>
<p>Now, website structure for a local business is not going to differ that
dramatically from general website structure. There are however, some
strategies we should talk about — ones specific to local businesses.</p>
<ul>
<li>You need individual pages for each service you offer</li>
<li>Support your service pages with the right blog posts</li>
</ul>
<h2>You need individual pages for each service you offer</h2>
<p>If you run a small business, your website absolutely needs individual pages
for every service you offer.</p>
<p>Why should you?</p>
<p>Because Google (and other search engines) rank your pages based on the content
on it. It's easier to rank for ""Newport lawn mowing service"" if you have a
page solely dedicated to it. You're more likely to rank for a keyword if your
meta tags, and page content are targeting it.</p>
<p>This is an approach SERP Co uses — each of the 7 main services have their own
dedicated pages.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-86-2.png"" /></p>
<p>The pages are extremely detailed, with images, persuasive copy and even
testimonials.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-88-1024x480-1.png"" /></p>
<p>The strategy is both superior for SEO and user experience.</p>
<p>This is opposed to having one services page for all the services that you
offer. With this strategy you're hurting your ranking potential, for each
individual service.</p>
<p>It's an inaccurate shotgun, versus a highly-targeted sniper rifle.</p>
<h2>Support your service pages with the right blog posts</h2>
<p>Now, with individual services pages, you're going to rank well. But that's not
the only thing we can do to improve those pages' rankings.</p>
<p><strong>You need around 1-3 high-quality blog posts based around each service that
you offer.</strong></p>
<p>The key is you want these blog posts to link back to the specific service page
they relate to, using a keyword variation.</p>
<p>So, for example, lets say you created a service page for gutter cleaning
services, and created a blog titled ""how to clean your gutters."" You would
simply place a link from the blog post, to the service page, making sure you
use a keyword variation. A keyword variation example would be, ""gutter
cleaning services in [location].</p>
<h3>Other Things to Know About Website Structure</h3>
<p>There are some other more, ""miscellaneous"" items of website structure we
should detail.</p>
<ul>
<li>Breadcrumbs</li>
<li>Menus for navigation</li>
<li>Keep URL slugs clean and simple</li>
<li>CTAs</li>
</ul>
<h4>Breadcrumbs</h4>
<p>Breadcrumbs are the small text paths you see at the top of pages. They look
like this.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-72-2.png"" /></p>
<p>Basically a line of hyperlink texts that tells you how far/many pages you are
from the homepage.</p>
<p>They make it easy for both users and search engines to navigate your website.</p>
<p><strong>There are technically multiple types of breadcrumbs.</strong></p>
<p>There are ones that show how far you are from the homepage (like the example
above.)</p>
<p><img alt=""breadcrumbs hierarchy"" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/breadcrumbs_bestbuy-600x298-1.png"" />source: yoast</p>
<p>E-commerce ones that detail all the category attributes you have added to your
store search.</p>
<p><img alt=""breadcrumbs attribute"" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/breadcrumbs_officedepot-600x316-1.png"" /></p>
<p>And ones that show your recent history on the website.</p>
<p><img alt=""breadcrumbs history"" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/breadcrumbs_macys.png"" /></p>
<p>They all have their place regarding website structure. Just make sure your
website has breadcrumbs — it's an easy way to boost website structure.</p>
<h2>Menus for navigation</h2>
<p><strong>When it comes to website navigation, there are 2 almost universal features
you must have.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A header menu</li>
<li>A footer menu</li>
</ul>
<p>A header menu is the menu at the top of a website. It looks like this.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-71-1024x480-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Almost every website made today has one — this is because they make navigation
easy.</p>
<p>I'd recommend making sure that it scrolls down the page with you. There will
be a setting for that in your CMS.</p>
<p>The footer menu is the menu at the very bottom of a page.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-70-1024x480-1.png"" /></p>
<p>This is also fairly standard practice. It seems to help navigation, while not
being intrusive.</p>
<p>Make sure your local business website has these two menus.</p>
<h4>Keep URL slugs clean and simple</h4>
<p>Another aspect of website structure, is the URL slugs of each page.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-90.png"" /></p>
<p>Each page has its own unique URL slug — from the category pages, to the
subcategories and the posts. Technically the homepage has no slug I guess...
It's the homepage — it needs no slug.</p>
<p>URL slugs can be simple like the example above, or more complex — indicating
you are further down a website.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-91-2.png"" /></p>
<p>Having clean, easy to understand URL slugs helps both search engines and users
navigate the depths of your website.</p>
<p><strong>Try to keep it short, use hyphens to separate words, and use a keyword if it
contextually makes sense.</strong></p>
<h2>CTAs</h2>
<p>Call to actions (CTA) are buttons on a website that typically lead to a
landing page, or something of importance.</p>
<p><img alt=""Image result for call to action"" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/call-to-action20examples20skimm.jpg"" /></p>
<p>It's important to note that opt-in forms and CTAs are not exactly the same
thing. The call to action is the button ON an opt-in form.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-73-2.png"" /></p>
<p>A CTA can be used in many different ways/contexts. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pop-ups</li>
<li>Header menus</li>
<li>Sidebars</li>
<li>At the bottom of blog posts/content</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding good website structure, call to actions act as a way to lead users
to important pages/places.</p>
<p>Make sure you try to make them ""un-intrusive."" If you are using a pop-up with
a CTA for example, use an exit-intent one.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-75-1024x571-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Using a bright, contrasting button color can help grab attention, leading to
more clicks.</p>
<p><img alt=""Image result for call to action color"" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/main-qimg-7bf50175ac8c4bf159ec59caa4dda41f.webp"" /></p>
<p>You can also attach a ""lead magnet"" to your call to actions. A lead magnet is
something of value, like an eBook, report, or cheat-sheet.</p>
<p><img alt=""Image result for types of lead magnets"" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

<h2>Part 5: Branding &amp; Design</h2>
<p>With structure out of the way, the last element to your local business website
is branding and design.</p>
<p>Before we get into things, we should <em>define</em> what website <em>branding</em> and
<em>design</em> are.</p>
<h3>What is Website Branding and Design?</h3>
<p>Website design is the visual appearance of your website — it's the tone and
feel it creates. This includes everything from your website color scheme, logo
and page layout.</p>
<p>As a local business, you need a website that makes a strong, professional, yet
unique impression. It needs to be appropriate based on your industry and
country of business. This is all crucial to building consumer trust and
confidence.</p>
<h3>Effective Branding/Design Strategies</h3>
<p>There are a number of different branding &amp; design strategies you need to
implement.</p>
<ul>
<li>Responsive design</li>
<li>Consistent design and color scheme</li>
<li>Header and footer menus</li>
<li>Logo on top header bar</li>
<li>Phone number on top header bar</li>
<li>SSL certificate (HTTPS)</li>
<li>Social proof</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE: most of these things come with website templates automatically. It
does help to actually know <em>why</em> you need them however.</strong></p>
<h4>Responsive design</h4>
<p>This is, the, most important website design strategy — one you <strong>MUST</strong>
implement.</p>
<p>A responsive design is basically a function that allows your website to change
its size/proportions, based on the device used.</p>
<p>Regardless of what device someone has, they can use your website. Mobile,
laptop, desktop, tablet... It doesn't matter. Your website adapts.</p>
<p>In a world of smartphones dominating internet usage, this is absolutely vital.</p>
<p>Your CMS should come with responsive design function for your website — it's a
standard feature these days. Pretty much all WordPress themes come with it.</p>
<h4>Consistent design and color scheme</h4>
<p>Each and every page of your website needs to have a consistent design and
color scheme. Look at how every SERP Co page has the same color and font.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-95-1024x223-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Each page is going to have its own unique page layout — this depends on page
type (homepage/about/services/contact etc.)</p>
<p>Make sure that each and every page on your website has the same font and color
scheme. This will make your website look professional, and your business
authentic.</p>
<h4>Header and footer menus</h4>
<p>This was covered in website structure, but it's also a design element, so I'll
rehash here.</p>
<p>Header and footer menus are universal design features that all websites have.</p>
<p><img alt=""This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is
image-71-1024x480.png"" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-71-1024x480-1.png"" /></p>
<p><img alt=""This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is
image-70-1024x480.png"" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-70-1024x480-1.png"" /></p>
<p>You can add these menus to your website with your CMS platform.</p>
<h4>Logo on top header bar</h4>
<p>Your business logo should feature on your top header bar — the top corner,
adjacent your header menu works well.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-92-1024x480-1.png"" /></p>
<p>This can be done through your CMS platform.</p>
<h4>Phone number on top header bar</h4>
<p>As a local business, you'll want your phone number on your top header bar,
along with your business logo and header menu.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-93-2.png"" /></p>
<p>This makes it easy for your website visitors to contact you.</p>
<p>Also done through your CMS.</p>
<h4>SSL certificate (HTTPS)</h4>
<p>Even if you're not selling anything online, you still should have a SSL
certificate.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recommended Reading</strong> : <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/http-vs-https/"">HTTP vs. HTTPS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A SSL certificate is basically an extra-level of security for your website —
this is never a bad thing.</p>
<p><img alt=""Image result for ssl certificate"" src=""https://cdn.pixelprivacy.com/wp-
content/uploads/2018/05/SSL-Example.png"" /></p>
<p>But why we really want it, is because Google ranks websites with it, better.
It also instills trust and comfort in people who visit your website.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: If you are an ecommerce website, then a SSL certificate is a MUST.</strong></p>
<h4>Social proof</h4>
<p>You need to make sure your website is littered with ""social proof.""</p>
<p>Social proof is basically things that suggest, show or imply your social
status. It's a way to show your credentials, competency and success. It
influences what people say, do or think.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-94-2.png"" /></p>
<p>There are many ways we can use social proof for a local business website. Some
methods include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer testimonials</li>
<li>Reviews</li>
<li>""Who we've worked with"" panels</li>
<li>Case studies</li>
<li>Awards/accreditation </li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of some customer testimonials — complete with pictures and
quotes.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2020-03-06-at-12.42.03-pm-1024x468-1.png"" /></p>
<p>And here's a ""who we've worked with"" panel variation.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2020-03-06-at-12.41.00-pm-1024x273-1.png"" /></p>
<p>As a local small business, you need to persuade potential customers that you
are the best choice. Littering your website with lots of social proof is key.</p>
<h2>Part 6: Performance</h2>
<p>Even after creating your website, your job is not done. When it comes to
websites, the job is never done. You need to be consistently monitoring the
performance of your domain. Below I will show you what you need to monitor,
and how.</p>
<p><strong>There are 4 main aspects of performance we will address.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Page Speed</li>
<li>Mobile Optimization</li>
<li>XML Sitemap</li>
<li>Analytics</li>
</ul>
<h3>Page Speed</h3>
<p>How fast the pages of your website load is vitally important. Did you know
bounce rate skyrockets when page speed increases? It's common sense, but take
a look at this.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-80.png"" /></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.link-assistant.com/news/mobile-
seo-2018.html"">Research from Google</a> — a page taking an extra 5 seconds to load increases bounce
rate by 106%.</p>
<p>FYI — for those of you who don't know, bounce rate is people leaving you
website... So it's not good. At all.</p>
<p>So how can we address, and optimize the speed of our website?</p>
<p><strong>Follow these best practices and strategies.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Find out what your websites page speed is</li>
<li>Use a CDN</li>
<li>Use caching</li>
<li>Compress your images</li>
</ul>
<h4>Find out what your websites page speed is</h4>
<p>First thing we need to do is to discover whether our website is actually slow
or not.</p>
<p>We'll do this with <a href=""https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/"">Google PageSpeed
Insights</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-96-1024x505-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Google Pagespeed Insights is a performance test of your website — it's
completely free to use. The test can be run for both desktop and mobile
versions of a website.</p>
<p>After entering your websites URL, you'll get an analysis of your website page
speed. Most of it is overly technical — focus on the rating at the top.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-97-1024x485-1.png"" /></p>
<p>A 57/100 rating is mediocre — this means we can improve.</p>
<p><strong>BONUS: There is a suggestions panel of things you can do to boost page
speed.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-98.png"" /></p>
<p>With this analysis, you should have a clear idea about the speed of your
website.</p>
<h4>Use a CDN</h4>
<p>A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a type of network that utilizes
geographical location to effectively connect a user to a webpage. It basically
just reduces the distance between the two.</p>
<p><strong>What's important is that a CDN can decrease page loading times.</strong></p>
<p>Take this case study for example — UK based company <a href=""https://www.ventureharbour.com/content-delivery-
network/#comparison"">Venture Harbour improved
website speed by 30.2%</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a ""before photo"" speed test.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-97.png"" /></p>
<p>And here's after.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-98.png"" /></p>
<p>They said this only took 20 minutes to achieve this result. Talk about bang
for your buck.</p>
<h4>Use caching</h4>
<p>Caching is a function that allows visitors to temporarily ""remember"" aspects
of a website. There is a temporary memory storage that allows the website to
be loaded faster when revisited.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-96.png"" /></p>
<p>Caching is an easy way to decrease page loading times for your repeat
visitors.</p>
<p>The easiest way to add caching to your website is with a WordPress plugin. <a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/"">W3
Total Cache</a> is the most
popular choice.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/7AsNSSrZq4Y</p>
<h4>Compress your images</h4>
<p>Compressing your images is when you convert an image to a more optimal format
— one with a smaller file size.</p>
<p><strong>The result is easier-to-load images, making page speed faster.</strong></p>
<p>It doesn't change the visual appearance of an image either.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-95.png"" /></p>
<p>You can use <a href=""https://tinypng.com/"">TinyPNG</a> to compress your images.</p>
<p>This might not seem like it'd do much, but consider how many images you have
on your website.</p>
<h3>Mobile Optimization</h3>
<p>We briefly touched on mobile optimization in website design, but we'll go more
in-depth here. I'll explain why you need need it, and how to check everything
is running smoothly.</p>
<p><strong>FYI — mobile optimization is easily achieved by using a responsive web
design. Refer to ""Part 4: Branding &amp; Design.""</strong></p>
<p>The need for mobile optimization came into play with the advent of the
smartphone — around the start of the 2010's.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-76.png"" /></p>
<p>With the smartphone being the dominant ""system"" it's only natural that
majority of internet usage is done through it. We even have statistics to
prove this.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/word-image-77.png"" /></p>
<p>We live in a mobile-dominated internet age. Google even switched its search
index to ""mobile-first.""</p>
<p>So that's <em>why</em> you need mobile optimization.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, we can use <a href=""//search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly"">Google's Mobile-Friendly Test
tool</a> to see where we stand.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-100-1024x504-1.png"" /></p>
<p>It should give you a clear idea about whether your page is properly optimized
for smartphones.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-101-1024x440-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Individually run through and test every page on your website — if it's good
for Google, it's good enough.</p>
<h3>XML Sitemap</h3>
<p>Ideally you want all pages of your website crawled by search engines,
particularly important ones. This doesn't always happen — in these instances,
a XML sitemap can be valuable.</p>
<p>A XML Sitemap is basically a map that tells Google (and others) the location
of important pages on your website. It's your way of communicating, making
sure your best pages are crawled. It can also be used for images, videos and
other files besides webpages.</p>
<p>Here's how it looks — it's text file with lots of code.</p>
<p><img alt=""Image result for xml sitemap example"" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/xml-sitemap-example-how-to-setup-xml-

<p>Looks overly technical but they are easy to make — we'll cover it in a second.</p>
<p>You're probably wondering if you actually need a XML sitemap... <a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/156184?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=4581190"">According to
Google</a>,
if your website is:</p>
<ul>
<li>New</li>
<li>Large</li>
<li>Has a lot of videos or images</li>
<li>Lots of pages poorly linked</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you should have one.</p>
<h4>How to create a XML sitemap</h4>
<p>The easiest way to create a XML sitemap is to use the <a href=""https://en-au.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/"">WordPress SEO plugin
Yoast</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-102-2.png"" /></p>
<p>To find the XML sitemap function, you'll want to go <strong>SEO &gt; General</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-103-2.png"" /></p>
<p>Click on the ""Features"" panel — you'll see the option for XML sitemaps below.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-104-2.png"" /></p>
<p>When activated, you can press the little question mark and see your XML
sitemap live.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-106.png"" /></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-105-2.png"" /></p>
<h4>Use Google Search Console to submit your XML sitemap</h4>
<p>Google can find your XML sitemap on its own, but why not just give it to them?
<a href=""//search.google.com/search-console/welcome"">Google Search Console</a> allows you
to do this.</p>
<p>There should be a ""Sitemaps"" option on the sidebar.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-search-
console_sitemaps.png"" /></p>
<p>Add your XML sitemap URL to both boxes.</p>
<p><img alt=""Google Search Console Add New Sitemap"" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/google-search-console_sitemaps_add-new.png"" /></p>
<p>The first one (site property) only needs the tail of your URL. The other one
(domain property) will need your entire URL, domain included.</p>
<h3>Analytics</h3>
<p>Having some form of analytics is crucial for addressing website performance.</p>
<p><strong>FYI</strong> <strong>— Analytics is basically the analysis of statistics, to forecast
future outcomes. It gives us insight to what's working, what's not, and
necessary changes needed to be made.</strong></p>
<p>There are many options for analytics — we'll be using <a href=""https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/"">Google
Analytics</a></p>
<h4>Setting up Google Analytics</h4>
<p>Setting up Google Analytics for your website is easy — go to the signup page
and enter in your details.</p>
<p><img alt=""Sign in with your Google account"" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/signinwithga.png"" /></p>
<p>If you already have a Google account, you'll just log in with that.</p>
<p>You'll then be asked to give your website information.</p>
<p><img alt=""Provide website details"" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/gasetup-4.jpg"" /></p>
<p>Once that's done you'll then have to accept their terms and service, and your
Google Analytics account will be created.</p>
<h4>Statistics to look out for</h4>
<p>Google Analytics gives you 5 different types of analytical reports, each with
unique statistics. These 5 reports are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Real-time</strong> — Shows a ""live"" view of your website's traffic</li>
<li><strong>Audience</strong> — Shows research about your website visitors</li>
<li><strong>Acquisition</strong> — Shows how and where your website visitors come from</li>
<li><strong>Behavior</strong> — Shows how website visitors act/behave on your domain</li>
<li><strong>Conversion</strong> — Shows your success based on specified goals</li>
</ul>
<p>As a small local business you should focus on <strong>organic traffic</strong> , which is a
measure of how many website visitors you get on your website/pages. You can
find this under the ""Audience"" report/tab, clicking on overview and adding a
new segment.</p>

In a nutshell, Google Maps marketing is the process of using Google Maps
functionality to make your business easier to find.

Although this can be very useful (and expected) for large companies, it’s even
more indispensable for smaller businesses.

If you can get your business to show up in the top of the maps area you will
generate a significant amount of new customer calls & website visits to your
business, instead of your competitors.

Here is a screenshot from one of our dental seo clients who is benefitting
hugely from Google Maps. Look at all those potential customers just in the
last 30 days:

### Google My Business

Formerly known as Google Places, [Google My
Business](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/06/local-business-
marketing) enables business owners to claim a listing (aka profile page) for
their business that may appear in Google search results.

Virtually any type of business (with the exception of certain more risqué
establishments) can claim a Google My Business listing, which will display
information that searchers may want to know, such as address, opening hours,
phone number, website link, customer reviews, etc.

![Google Maps marketing Google My Business](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/google-maps-marketing-google-my-business.png)

Google My Business (GMB) is a cornerstone of any successful [local
seo](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/) campaign, and it is critical that
you understand how to most effectively optimize your GMB profile for maximum
SEO impact.

**Hint** : keep reading and we will tell you exactly what you need to know...
Get excited!

### Google Maps

Google Maps – you've seen it, you've used it, and now you will learn to master
it (for the benefit of your business). Google Maps
(<https://maps.google.com/>) is a web mapping service that helps consumers
discover, locate, contact & navigate to businesses and places of interest.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-maps-
summary.png)

However, Google Maps is not just a standalone web mapping service that helps
people from getting lost on their way to their destination, it also takes up a
massively prominent area of the organic SERPs for any search query that Google
deems encompasses search intent that would warrant showing a local business.

For example, if you type ""diy desk ideas"" there is really no intent there to
talk to a local business, because you are basically asking Google ""hey Google,
I want to learn how to make a desk at home, can you give me ideas?""

So the SERP you get is much more _informational_ oriented. See:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/serp_result_for_diy_desk_ideas2-505x1024-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/03/SERP_result_for_diy_desk_ideas2.png)

No need for maps or ""local results"".

However, what if your search was something like ""desk stores near me"". Think
that SERP will look a little different?

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/serp_result_for_a_local_query2-289x1024-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/03/SERP_result_for_a_local_query2.png)

In this search Google knows the **intent** of the searcher is to get options
of stores where they can to buy a desk, the SERP is has more _local_ results.

And look at that ""Map Pack"" - it takes up the entire top of the page!

Extremely valuable real estate.

### GMB Optimization for Showing up in Google Maps

Getting up in the maps is hugely dependent on the optimization of your GMB.

After all, this is a public facing “mini website” that is given to you by
Google and shown to their customers - they want to make sure you fill it out
fully, properly & trustworthy-ly. #notarealword

 **The Google My Business Optimization Checklist** :

  1.  **Verified GMB**
  2.  **URLs** \- main URL, appointment URL, use UTM parameters if you have multiple GMBs to track where things come from
  3.  **Business Category(s)** \- Primary & Secondary
  4.  **[Operating Hours](http://Business Operating Hours)**
  5.  **Business Description** \- Completely filled out with details & keywords
  6.  **Images** \- Keywords in filenames, geotag, EXIF data, etc.
  7.  **Videos**
  8.  **Services**
  9.  **Google Website**
  10.  **Reviews**

#### Verified GMB

The beginning of all Google Maps Marketing starts with getting your business a
**verified** Google My Business profile.

The best way to verify your Google My Business profile is with a postcard.

Sign up for a GMB by going to business.google.com, and submitting all your
information. Google will then ask to 'verify' that your business actually
exists at the address you entered by sending you a postcard with a 5 digit
verification code, looking something like this:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-my-business-
verification-postcard.jpg)

When you get it, simply enter the code on the GMB profile you made, and Voila!
you're now verified (and have the ability to show up on Google Maps).

#### Proper Website URL Destinations for Google My Business

Specify the URL destinations properly. You have 2 spots - the primary website,
and the best place for consumers to contact you.

I recommend you use two different URLs here.

The first URL should be the landing page that is most relevant to the business
location. In this example, we are showing our GMB for the SERP Co Seattle
location, so we point the GMB to the landing page for [SERP Co - Seattle
SEO](https://devinschumacher.com//seattle).

The second URL, goes to the general/main
""[Contact](https://devinschumacher.com/contact/)"" page.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/contact-
information-links-on-a-google-my-business-profile.png)

##### UTM Codes for Tracking Traffic from Google Maps

A UTM code is something you can add to the end of your URL that gives more
information to Google Analytics about your website trsff

#### Primary & Additional Business Categories

You tell Google what your business is all about. This starts with categorizing
your business. Make sure you choose the most relevant Primary Category.

You can do this by knowing your business, looking at the category options, and
also performing some searches yourself to see what other business are showing
up for the keywords _you want to be showing up for_.

For example, if we Google ""[seo company los
angeles](https://devinschumacher.com//los-angeles/)"" we will see that all 3
business who are displaying in the organic (aka not-paid) area of Google Maps
for this query have designated their Primary Category as ""internet marketing
service"". So, if we want to have the Best chance to show up for this keyword
search as well it would behoove us to designate our business primary category
the same way.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/google_maps_search_results_for_seo_company_los_angeles.png)

#### Business Operating Hours

This one is pretty obvious - fill out your business hours completely so
consumers (and Google) have an accurate understanding of when you are open.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-my-business-
hours-of-operations.png)

#### Business Description

The business description area is an opportunity for you to succinctly describe
(and pitch) your business to potential buyers.

Like all things in SEO, you'll want to fill this out correctly and completely,
using details and keyword variations (both service related, and geo related)
to describe your business to consumers, while giving Google nuggets of
relevant information you want it to associate with your brand.

#### Images

Images are huge for local SEO & Google Maps marketing.

 **Adding images to your GMB helps:**

  1. Give your business more legitimacy, trust & ""authority"".
  2. Take up space on image SERPs. 
  3. Generate impressions & clicks.
  4. Provides additional opportunities for you to improve the relevance of your business to Google ([image filenames](https://devinschumacher.com/image-filenames/), schema, EXIF data, Geotagging, etc.)

Check this out, in the last month alone this GMB generated 100s of image views
by customers:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2020-03-08-at-2.29.24-pm.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2020-03-08-at-2.29.24-pm.png)

A small, but legitimate win & competitive advantage - give yourself all the
advantages you can.

#### Videos

Videos, like images, improve your trust, relevance, authority & web presence.

There are many different types of videos you should add to your Google My
Business listing (and have for other digital marketing channels like email,
ads, social media, etc.).

These include selfie videos, office tour videos, 360 videos, meet the team
videos, etc.

We cover all the types of videos you need for your business in depth in our
members only group, [SERP University](http://serpuniversity.com) (join free).

#### Business Services

Your services - these are the lifeblood of your business. Customers have tons
of options for solving their problems these days, and to be quite frank - your
product may not be unique or special.

However, that doesn't mean There are not aspects of how you deliver your
products and services that set you apart from the competition. After you have
identified your Unique Value Propositions (UVP), aka ""what makes you
different"", Do you want to fully detailed those in the service area.

Use this opportunity to write some unique content about each one of the
services you provide, how do you provide it, and most importantly the benefits
that a customer will receive from your products and services.

Remember to use [SEO keywords](https://devinschumacher.com/seo-keywords/),
[keyword variations & LSIs](https://devinschumacher.com/lsi-keywords/), [long
tail keywords](https://devinschumacher.com/long-tail-keywords/), keyword
synonyms etc. when talking about your services.

#### Google Website

Google gives you the option of generating a free website in a single click. It
creates a one-pager with all the information you have added to your GMB
profile, which is great.

 **Pro-tip** : Whenever Google gives you the ability to create a web property
for free using one of their domains, do it.

Create a free Google business website, and then edit it to drop some links to
your website & social properties - lots of good relevance and keywords to be
had!

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2020-03-08_at_3_00_07_pm-1024x509-1.png)

#### Online Reviews for Google Maps

Reviews are a huge part of local seo. They build trust for consumers, and
Google likes seeing that activity as well, as it validates you are in fact a
legitimate, active business.

 **Check out some of these online review stats:**

  *  _91% of millennials trust online reviews as much as friends and family._
  *  _A single business review can lift its conversions by 10%._
  *  _72% of customers won’t take action before they read some reviews._

So what's your action plan? Get reviews.

Email all of your previous customers and see if they would write you an honest
review of their experience.

Remind your new customers that they can leave you a review on Google, Yelp,
Facebook, etc. if they would like to share their experience.

Do whatever you gotta do to get those review stars!

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-5-3.gif)

### On Page Optimization

Now that you have created & optimized your Google Business listing, it's time
to optimize the corresponding landing page.

Remember the step about URLs? Here it is in case you already forgot.

The destination of that URL is what we are referring to when we say ""landing
page"".

For most businesses, you will use your homepage as the URL. However, if you
have more than one location (or GMB) you will want to take advantage of local
landers (like we did in the example).

  1.  **NAP** \- This stands for Name, Address, Phone Number. Make sure that is is present on the your landing page (and that it exactly matches the information on your GMB).
  2.  **Map embed** \- Get the map embed code from your GMB live listing, and add it to your landing page.
  3.  **Driving Directions** \- Create driving directions in [Google My Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/), and embed that on your lander too. You can also get the directions and put the text on your lander as well.
  4.  **Interlinks** \- Interlink your relevant pages together. Add links from relevant blog posts to your landing page. Relevant [internal links](https://devinschumacher.com/internal-links/) help Googlebot crawl more easily, and passes link power through your site more freely.
  5.  **Relevance** \- Create as much relevance for your SERVICE and GEO as possible on your local lander. Keep it specific and comprehensive to the service and location you are trying to promote (ie: [digital marketing services in los angeles, ca](https://devinschumacher.com/services/marketing/los-angeles/)).
  6.  **On Page SEO Optimization** \- Follow proper [on page seo optimization best practices](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/) to optimize your landing page.
  7.  **UR** \- UR is an acronym for URL Rating, by Ahrefs. It basically calculates how ""authoritative"" or ""powerful"" your specific URL is, based on the quantity & quality of [backlinks](https://devinschumacher.com/backlinks/) you have. Continually work on [link building](https://devinschumacher.com/link-building/) to improve the UR of your landing page.

### Authority, Relevance, Trust

#### Authority

Authority refers to how ""powerful"" your website is in Google's mind. Your
domain as a whole has authority, called Domain Rating (DR). The individual URL
you are trying to rank (remember, ""landing page"") also has authority, called
URL Rating (UR).

By improving both the DR & UR of your website you will have an easier time
showing up in the organic SERPs AND in the Map SERPs.

Work on building your DR & UR with [link
building](https://devinschumacher.com/link-building/).

#### Relevance

Relevance refers to how closely connected or appropriate you are to the search
query being performed by a user.

Relevance, like authority, can apply both to your domain as a whole and the
individual URL you are trying to rank.

Focus on building relevance by creating content for your website that is
relevant to the services you provide. One of the best ways to do this is to
write blog content around a specific topic (ie your service page). Next, add
links in the blog posts to the related service. Finally, use [outreach link
building](https://devinschumacher.com//outreach-link-building/) to acquire
links to the blog posts - which will push power from the blog post to the
service page. Rinse & repeat this process until you have built enough
relevance that your SERP position starts improving.

#### Prominence

Prominence is basically Google's term for popularity.

Popularity usually means that a brand has spent significant resources on
branding & marketing so consumers are familiar with their product (like
Doritos in the Super Bowl, for example).

Google is more likely to rank these businesses with prominence higher in local
results, because consumers are more comfortable with brands they know.

How do you increase prominence? Well, basically by doing SEO & brand building.

There are alot of brands with very high authority who don't do SEO simply
because their offline strategies have garnered them so much attention (for
example, that law firm with billboards and radio jingles you've seen & heard
the last 10 years - chances are they have pretty good authority even if they
neglected SEO).

You don't need the next smash hit Super Bowl commercial to build prominence,
and in reality you aren't even expected to if you are a small business.
Remember, the SERPs are relative. So if a few legit press releases & community
news articles are a big deal in the size of industry & town you're in that may
be all you need to snag those top spots for ""dentist near me"".

#### Proximity

Proximity to the searcher is definitely an important factor. Google knows
people don’t want to travel as far for a gas station as they would for an eye
surgery. So, proximity is industry dependent - but still a factor

The type of business you are will determine the proximity filter.

For example, Google knows that consumers will typically not want to drive as
far for ""coffee near me"" as they will for ""heart surgeon near me"", simply
because one of those isn't quite as important. I'll let you guess which one.

### Off Page Optimization

[Off Page SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/off-page-seo/) is a huge topic, and
we're not going to cover it entirely in this post, but here is a solid

<p>In a nutshell, Google Maps marketing is the process of using Google Maps
functionality to make your business easier to find.</p>
<p>Although this can be very useful (and expected) for large companies, it’s even
more indispensable for smaller businesses.</p>
<p>If you can get your business to show up in the top of the maps area you will
generate a significant amount of new customer calls &amp; website visits to your
business, instead of your competitors.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot from one of our dental seo clients who is benefitting
hugely from Google Maps. Look at all those potential customers just in the
last 30 days:</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-maps-
insights-from-dental-seo.png"" /></p>
<h3>Google My Business</h3>
<p>Formerly known as Google Places, <a href=""https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2015/04/06/local-business-
marketing"">Google My
Business</a> enables business owners to claim a listing (aka profile page) for
their business that may appear in Google search results.</p>
<p>Virtually any type of business (with the exception of certain more risqué
establishments) can claim a Google My Business listing, which will display
information that searchers may want to know, such as address, opening hours,
phone number, website link, customer reviews, etc.</p>
<p><img alt=""Google Maps marketing Google My Business"" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/google-maps-marketing-google-my-business.png"" /></p>
<p>Google My Business (GMB) is a cornerstone of any successful <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/"">local
seo</a> campaign, and it is critical that
you understand how to most effectively optimize your GMB profile for maximum
SEO impact.</p>
<p><strong>Hint</strong> : keep reading and we will tell you exactly what you need to know...
Get excited!</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-4-5.gif"" /></p>
<h3>Google Maps</h3>
<p>Google Maps – you've seen it, you've used it, and now you will learn to master
it (for the benefit of your business). Google Maps
(<a href=""https://maps.google.com/"">https://maps.google.com/</a>) is a web mapping service that helps consumers
discover, locate, contact &amp; navigate to businesses and places of interest.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-maps-
summary.png"" /></p>
<p>However, Google Maps is not just a standalone web mapping service that helps
people from getting lost on their way to their destination, it also takes up a
massively prominent area of the organic SERPs for any search query that Google
deems encompasses search intent that would warrant showing a local business.</p>
<p>For example, if you type ""diy desk ideas"" there is really no intent there to
talk to a local business, because you are basically asking Google ""hey Google,
I want to learn how to make a desk at home, can you give me ideas?""</p>
<p>So the SERP you get is much more <em>informational</em> oriented. See:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/03/SERP_result_for_diy_desk_ideas2.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/serp_result_for_diy_desk_ideas2-505x1024-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>No need for maps or ""local results"".</p>
<p>However, what if your search was something like ""desk stores near me"". Think
that SERP will look a little different?</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/03/SERP_result_for_a_local_query2.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/serp_result_for_a_local_query2-289x1024-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>In this search Google knows the <strong>intent</strong> of the searcher is to get options
of stores where they can to buy a desk, the SERP is has more <em>local</em> results.</p>
<p>And look at that ""Map Pack"" - it takes up the entire top of the page!</p>
<p>Extremely valuable real estate.</p>
<h2>The Importance of Google Maps Marketing</h2>
<ul>
<li>72% оf consumers whо реrfоrm a local based search will vіѕіt a business within 5 miles of them.</li>
<li>50% оf consumer searches on Google Maps lеаd tо ѕtоrе vіѕіtѕ wіthіn a day.</li>
<li>78% of mоbіlе ѕеаrсhеѕ rеѕult іn аn оfflіnе рurсhаѕе.</li>
<li>Companies wіth complete &amp; detailed information on their Google Mу Buѕіnеѕѕ profiles are 2x as likely tо bе considered rерutаblе by соnѕumеrѕ.</li>
<li>Addіng rich media (рhоtоѕ &amp; video) tо уоur GMB lіѕtіng drive 42% more requests for ""driving dіrесtіоnѕ"", and 35% more website clicks from Gооglе Mарѕ.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Google Maps Marketing Must-Dos</h2>
<ul>
<li>GMB Optimization</li>
<li>On Page Optimization</li>
<li>Authority, Relevance, Trust</li>
<li>Proximity</li>
<li>Off Page Optimization</li>
</ul>
<h3>GMB Optimization for Showing up in Google Maps</h3>
<p>Getting up in the maps is hugely dependent on the optimization of your GMB.</p>
<p>After all, this is a public facing “mini website” that is given to you by
Google and shown to their customers - they want to make sure you fill it out
fully, properly &amp; trustworthy-ly. #notarealword</p>
<p><strong>The Google My Business Optimization Checklist</strong> :</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Verified GMB</strong></li>
<li><strong>URLs</strong> - main URL, appointment URL, use UTM parameters if you have multiple GMBs to track where things come from</li>
<li><strong>Business Category(s)</strong> - Primary &amp; Secondary</li>
<li><strong><a href=""http://Business Operating Hours"">Operating Hours</a></strong></li>
<li><strong>Business Description</strong> - Completely filled out with details &amp; keywords</li>
<li><strong>Images</strong> - Keywords in filenames, geotag, EXIF data, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Videos</strong></li>
<li><strong>Services</strong></li>
<li><strong>Google Website</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reviews</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>Verified GMB</h4>
<p>The beginning of all Google Maps Marketing starts with getting your business a
<strong>verified</strong> Google My Business profile.</p>
<p>The best way to verify your Google My Business profile is with a postcard.</p>
<p>Sign up for a GMB by going to business.google.com, and submitting all your
information. Google will then ask to 'verify' that your business actually
exists at the address you entered by sending you a postcard with a 5 digit
verification code, looking something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-my-business-
verification-postcard.jpg"" /></p>
<p>When you get it, simply enter the code on the GMB profile you made, and Voila!
you're now verified (and have the ability to show up on Google Maps).</p>
<h4>Proper Website URL Destinations for Google My Business</h4>
<p>Specify the URL destinations properly. You have 2 spots - the primary website,
and the best place for consumers to contact you.</p>
<p>I recommend you use two different URLs here.</p>
<p>The first URL should be the landing page that is most relevant to the business
location. In this example, we are showing our GMB for the SERP Co Seattle
location, so we point the GMB to the landing page for <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com//seattle"">SERP Co - Seattle
SEO</a>.</p>
<p>The second URL, goes to the general/main
""<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/contact/"">Contact</a>"" page.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/contact-
information-links-on-a-google-my-business-profile.png"" /></p>
<h5>UTM Codes for Tracking Traffic from Google Maps</h5>
<p>A UTM code is something you can add to the end of your URL that gives more
information to Google Analytics about your website trsff</p>
<h4>Primary &amp; Additional Business Categories</h4>
<p>You tell Google what your business is all about. This starts with categorizing
your business. Make sure you choose the most relevant Primary Category.</p>
<p>You can do this by knowing your business, looking at the category options, and
also performing some searches yourself to see what other business are showing
up for the keywords <em>you want to be showing up for</em>.</p>
<p>For example, if we Google ""<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com//los-angeles/"">seo company los
angeles</a>"" we will see that all 3
business who are displaying in the organic (aka not-paid) area of Google Maps
for this query have designated their Primary Category as ""internet marketing
service"". So, if we want to have the Best chance to show up for this keyword
search as well it would behoove us to designate our business primary category
the same way.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/google_maps_search_results_for_seo_company_los_angeles.png"" /></p>
<h4>Business Operating Hours</h4>
<p>This one is pretty obvious - fill out your business hours completely so
consumers (and Google) have an accurate understanding of when you are open.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-my-business-
hours-of-operations.png"" /></p>
<h4>Business Description</h4>
<p>The business description area is an opportunity for you to succinctly describe
(and pitch) your business to potential buyers.</p>
<p>Like all things in SEO, you'll want to fill this out correctly and completely,
using details and keyword variations (both service related, and geo related)
to describe your business to consumers, while giving Google nuggets of
relevant information you want it to associate with your brand.</p>
<h4>Images</h4>
<p>Images are huge for local SEO &amp; Google Maps marketing.</p>
<p><strong>Adding images to your GMB helps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Give your business more legitimacy, trust &amp; ""authority"".</li>
<li>Take up space on image SERPs. </li>
<li>Generate impressions &amp; clicks.</li>
<li>Provides additional opportunities for you to improve the relevance of your business to Google (<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/image-filenames/"">image filenames</a>, schema, EXIF data, Geotagging, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Check this out, in the last month alone this GMB generated 100s of image views
by customers:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2020-03-08-at-2.29.24-pm.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2020-03-08-at-2.29.24-pm.png"" /></a></p>
<p>A small, but legitimate win &amp; competitive advantage - give yourself all the
advantages you can.</p>
<h4>Videos</h4>
<p>Videos, like images, improve your trust, relevance, authority &amp; web presence.</p>
<p>There are many different types of videos you should add to your Google My
Business listing (and have for other digital marketing channels like email,
ads, social media, etc.).</p>
<p>These include selfie videos, office tour videos, 360 videos, meet the team
videos, etc.</p>
<p>We cover all the types of videos you need for your business in depth in our
members only group, <a href=""http://serpuniversity.com"">SERP University</a> (join free).</p>
<h4>Business Services</h4>
<p>Your services - these are the lifeblood of your business. Customers have tons
of options for solving their problems these days, and to be quite frank - your
product may not be unique or special.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't mean There are not aspects of how you deliver your
products and services that set you apart from the competition. After you have
identified your Unique Value Propositions (UVP), aka ""what makes you
different"", Do you want to fully detailed those in the service area.</p>
<p>Use this opportunity to write some unique content about each one of the
services you provide, how do you provide it, and most importantly the benefits
that a customer will receive from your products and services.</p>
<p>Remember to use <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/seo-keywords/"">SEO keywords</a>,
<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/lsi-keywords/"">keyword variations &amp; LSIs</a>, <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/long-tail-keywords/"">long
tail keywords</a>, keyword
synonyms etc. when talking about your services.</p>
<h4>Google Website</h4>
<p>Google gives you the option of generating a free website in a single click. It
creates a one-pager with all the information you have added to your GMB
profile, which is great.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-tip</strong> : Whenever Google gives you the ability to create a web property
for free using one of their domains, do it.</p>
<p>Create a free Google business website, and then edit it to drop some links to
your website &amp; social properties - lots of good relevance and keywords to be
had!</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2020-03-08_at_3_00_07_pm-1024x509-1.png"" /></p>
<h4>Online Reviews for Google Maps</h4>
<p>Reviews are a huge part of local seo. They build trust for consumers, and
Google likes seeing that activity as well, as it validates you are in fact a
legitimate, active business.</p>
<p><strong>Check out some of these online review stats:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>91% of millennials trust online reviews as much as friends and family.</em></li>
<li><em>A single business review can lift its conversions by 10%.</em></li>
<li><em>72% of customers won’t take action before they read some reviews.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>So what's your action plan? Get reviews.</p>
<p>Email all of your previous customers and see if they would write you an honest
review of their experience.</p>
<p>Remind your new customers that they can leave you a review on Google, Yelp,
Facebook, etc. if they would like to share their experience.</p>
<p>Do whatever you gotta do to get those review stars!</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-5-3.gif"" /></p>
<h3>On Page Optimization</h3>
<p>Now that you have created &amp; optimized your Google Business listing, it's time
to optimize the corresponding landing page.</p>
<p>Remember the step about URLs? Here it is in case you already forgot.</p>
<p>The destination of that URL is what we are referring to when we say ""landing
page"".</p>
<p>For most businesses, you will use your homepage as the URL. However, if you
have more than one location (or GMB) you will want to take advantage of local
landers (like we did in the example).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>NAP</strong> - This stands for Name, Address, Phone Number. Make sure that is is present on the your landing page (and that it exactly matches the information on your GMB).</li>
<li><strong>Map embed</strong> - Get the map embed code from your GMB live listing, and add it to your landing page.</li>
<li><strong>Driving Directions</strong> - Create driving directions in <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/"">Google My Maps</a>, and embed that on your lander too. You can also get the directions and put the text on your lander as well.</li>
<li><strong>Interlinks</strong> - Interlink your relevant pages together. Add links from relevant blog posts to your landing page. Relevant <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/internal-links/"">internal links</a> help Googlebot crawl more easily, and passes link power through your site more freely.</li>
<li><strong>Relevance</strong> - Create as much relevance for your SERVICE and GEO as possible on your local lander. Keep it specific and comprehensive to the service and location you are trying to promote (ie: <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/services/marketing/los-angeles/"">digital marketing services in los angeles, ca</a>).</li>
<li><strong>On Page SEO Optimization</strong> - Follow proper <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/"">on page seo optimization best practices</a> to optimize your landing page.</li>
<li><strong>UR</strong> - UR is an acronym for URL Rating, by Ahrefs. It basically calculates how ""authoritative"" or ""powerful"" your specific URL is, based on the quantity &amp; quality of <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/backlinks/"">backlinks</a> you have. Continually work on <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/link-building/"">link building</a> to improve the UR of your landing page.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Authority, Relevance, Trust</h3>
<h4>Authority</h4>
<p>Authority refers to how ""powerful"" your website is in Google's mind. Your
domain as a whole has authority, called Domain Rating (DR). The individual URL
you are trying to rank (remember, ""landing page"") also has authority, called
URL Rating (UR).</p>
<p>By improving both the DR &amp; UR of your website you will have an easier time
showing up in the organic SERPs AND in the Map SERPs.</p>
<p>Work on building your DR &amp; UR with <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/link-building/"">link
building</a>.</p>
<h4>Relevance</h4>
<p>Relevance refers to how closely connected or appropriate you are to the search
query being performed by a user.</p>
<p>Relevance, like authority, can apply both to your domain as a whole and the
individual URL you are trying to rank.</p>
<p>Focus on building relevance by creating content for your website that is
relevant to the services you provide. One of the best ways to do this is to
write blog content around a specific topic (ie your service page). Next, add
links in the blog posts to the related service. Finally, use <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com//outreach-link-building/"">outreach link
building</a> to acquire
links to the blog posts - which will push power from the blog post to the
service page. Rinse &amp; repeat this process until you have built enough
relevance that your SERP position starts improving.</p>
<h4>Prominence</h4>
<p>Prominence is basically Google's term for popularity.</p>
<p>Popularity usually means that a brand has spent significant resources on
branding &amp; marketing so consumers are familiar with their product (like
Doritos in the Super Bowl, for example).</p>
<p>Google is more likely to rank these businesses with prominence higher in local
results, because consumers are more comfortable with brands they know.</p>
<p>How do you increase prominence? Well, basically by doing SEO &amp; brand building.</p>
<p>There are alot of brands with very high authority who don't do SEO simply
because their offline strategies have garnered them so much attention (for
example, that law firm with billboards and radio jingles you've seen &amp; heard
the last 10 years - chances are they have pretty good authority even if they
neglected SEO).</p>
<p>You don't need the next smash hit Super Bowl commercial to build prominence,
and in reality you aren't even expected to if you are a small business.
Remember, the SERPs are relative. So if a few legit press releases &amp; community
news articles are a big deal in the size of industry &amp; town you're in that may
be all you need to snag those top spots for ""dentist near me"".</p>
<h4>Proximity</h4>
<p>Proximity to the searcher is definitely an important factor. Google knows
people don’t want to travel as far for a gas station as they would for an eye
surgery. So, proximity is industry dependent - but still a factor</p>
<p>The type of business you are will determine the proximity filter.</p>
<p>For example, Google knows that consumers will typically not want to drive as
far for ""coffee near me"" as they will for ""heart surgeon near me"", simply
because one of those isn't quite as important. I'll let you guess which one.</p>
<h3>Off Page Optimization</h3>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/off-page-seo/"">Off Page SEO</a> is a huge topic, and
we're not going to cover it entirely in this post, but here is a solid
checklist of the things you want to attend to in order to help your business
rank in Google Maps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/citations/"">Citations</a></strong> - General citations, Aggregators, niche citations, local citations, competitor citations</li>
<li><strong>Tier 2 Links</strong> - Get links to your links</li>
<li><strong>Google Map Embeds</strong> - Get your Google Map embedded on other relevant websites</li>
<li><strong>Google Driving Directions</strong> - Create driving directions and get consumers to request them</li>
</ul>

 **Keyword difficulty**  (aka  **keyword**   **competition** ) is a hugely
important metric to look at while doing keyword research & creating your SEO
content strategy.

It essentially helps answers the question ""how hard will it be to rank for
this keyword""?

If you can understand how to navigate & evaluate this metric you are well on
your way to ranking for all the terms you want and bringing a flood of organic
traffic to your website.

Each SEO tool has its own way of calculating the difficulty of a keyword, so
in this article, we will be sure to cover each of the tools you can use, but
also give you some practical advice about how to approach this hugely
important part of SEO.

We will give you the step-by-step method that we use to understand what is
needed to win, and also uncover some of our top-secret strategies for
evaluating the _true keyword competition_ that will give you a super clear
picture of what you will need to rank above your competitors.

## What is Keyword Competition?

 **Keyword Competition** is a term that refers to _how difficult it will be to
rank your website for any given keyword._

Understanding the competition of any given keyword will help guide your SEO
strategy and answer questions like:

  * How hard will it be to rank for this keyword?
  * Can I legitimately compete to rank for this keyword?
  * Should I use my resources to try and rank for this keyword, or would they be better used elsewhere""?

SEO Tools usually give you an indication of how competitive a keyword is using
their own proprietary metrics, and they don't all take into account all of the
factors of competition - but they usually are calculated using some
combination of:

  *  **URL Strength** : How strong does your URL need to be
  *  **Domain Strength** : How strong does your Domain need to be
  *  **URL Trust** : How trustworthy does your URL need to be
  *  **Domain Trust** : How trustworthy does your Domain need to be
  *  **Number of Links** / **RDs** : How many links (or RDs) will you need to get to that URL
  *  **Time** : How much time it will take to rise to the top
  *  **Popularity** : Popularity of keyword (how many websites are trying to rank for this same term)
  *  **Content Optimization** : How well a piece of content is optimized for a certain keyword
  *  **SERP Features** : What (and how many) types of SERP features are taking up real estate.
  *  **Searcher Intent** : The closer you align your page to the intent of the searcher, the more you will solidify your rankings when it gets to page 1 - because people will click your link and convey the proper ""user signals"" to Google to show the algorithm what it needs to believe you do, in fact, have the best piece of content.

## Keyword Competition Tools

Each SEO Tool has its own proprietary way of calculating the difficulty of a
keyword, so let's start by understanding the main tools that give predictions
about keyword competition & breakdown how they calculate it.

  * Ahrefs
  * SEM Rush
  * Mangools
  * Moz
  * Bonus: Other tools

### Ahrefs

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ahrefs-
homepage-1024x547-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/ahrefs-homepage.png)

Ahrefs is a very popular SEO tool that helps SEOs effectively craft an SEO
strategy, providing a ton of data on your website, your competitors' websites,
the SERP features, etc.

Ahrefs has the biggest keyword database on the web, with over 7.4 billion
keywords (from more than 170 countries) growing.

Keyword Difficulty (KD) is the term Ahrefs uses for its metrics to help you
understand how competitive a keyword/search query is.

Keyword Difficulty measures the competitiveness of a keyword on a scale of
1-100.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ahrefs-keyword-
difficultry-1024x838-1.jpg)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/ahrefs-keyword-difficultry.jpg)

Keyword difficulty essentially tells you how many **referring domains you
need** to your page to rank for the keyword you want.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ahrefs-keyword-
diffiicuty-1024x311-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/ahrefs-keyword-diffiicuty.png)

#### Examples

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/keyword-
difficulty-kd-sv-on-ahrefs.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/keyword-difficulty-kd-sv-on-
ahrefs.png)[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/seo-
company-keyword-kd-sv-on-ahrefs.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/seo-company-keyword-kd-sv-on-ahrefs.png)

#### Pros

  * Ahrefs KD is our favorite metric to use to start the process of understanding the difficulty of a keyword.
  * Ahrefs KD is the most accurate _single_ measurement of a Keyword's Difficulty that we have used.
  * They have a nice browser extension called the Ahrefs Bar which allows you to see a SERP Overlay to compare websites side by side easily.

#### Cons

  * Ahrefs KD does not use on-page factors to determine how hard it can be to rank for a keyword.
  * Ahrefs KD shows 0 for a lot of KDs that we believe is a little...too relaxed.

### SEMRush

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/sem-rush-
homepage-1024x497-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/sem-rush-homepage.png)

Keyword Difficulty, on SEMrush, gives you an estimate of how hard it will be
to rank for your keyword from a new page on your website.

Like Ahrefs, their score is on a scale of 1-100.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/using-semrush-for-
understanding-keyword-competitiveness.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/using-semrush-for-understanding-keyword-
competitiveness.png)

The way they calculate KD must be very different though because the numbers
they pull are drastically different.

#### Examples

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/keyword-
difficulty-kd-sv-on-sem-rush.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/keyword-difficulty-kd-sv-on-sem-rush.png)

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/seo-company-
keyword-kd-sv-on-semrush.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/seo-company-keyword-kd-sv-on-semrush.png)

### Moz

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/using-moz-to-
evaluate-keyword-difficulty-and-
competition-1024x609-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/using-moz-to-evaluate-keyword-difficulty-and-
competition.png)

Moz was a very popular SEO tool, but these days I don't personally know many
people using it, simply because their crawler is not that fast and they
usually have way less websites in their database.

Moz has similar tools to Ahrefs & SEM Rush - features like seeing the
backlinks to your page, getting information about keyword difficulty & search
volume, etc.

They also have a nice browser extension called the Moz Bar which allows you to
see a SERP Overlay to compare websites side by side easily.

#### Examples

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/keyword-
difficulty-kd-sv-on-moz.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/keyword-difficulty-kd-sv-on-
moz.png)[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/seo-
company-keyword-kd-sv-on-moz.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/seo-company-keyword-kd-sv-on-moz.png)

#### Pros

  * They also have a nice browser extension called the Moz Bar which allows you to see a SERP Overlay to compare websites side by side easily.

#### Cons

  * Smaller database of websites.
  * Not as accurate backlink analysis - they miss a lot of links.

### Other Keyword Competition Tools

Just for the sake of being comprehensive, I wanted to include a list of some
other tools you can use to check the difficulty/competitiveness of keywords -
plus some of these are free.

  * Google Keyword Planner
  * SEOBook.com
  * KWFinder.com
  * SERPS.com
  * Alexa.com
  * Wordstream.com
  * Keywordtool.io

## How to Evaluate Keyword Competition

If we compare the findings from above, you can see, each tool gives a
drastically different readout of how competitive a search term is (and even
how much search volume there is).

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-06-at-11.10.40-am.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2019-10-06-at-11.10.40-am.png)

So, to combat this huge disparity of tools, we like to _start_ our keyword
competitiveness evaluation process by looking at metrics (truthfully we only
look at Ahrefs), and then we have some manual checks we can do to really get a
better understanding of the term.

The full process involves looking at a variety of data, rather than just one
metric (which we know does not take into account everything you need to rank -
because even the tools themselves say they don't factor in a lot of things
like on-page SEO.

### Understanding Keyword Competitiveness

  1. Keyword Difficulty (KD)
  2. Domain Rating (DR)
  3. URL Rating (UR)
  4. # of Results: Keyword
  5. # of Results: All in Title
  6. # of Results: All in URL
  7. Signs of Low Competition
  8. SERP Stability (Position History)
  9. Keyword Difficulty Baseline

#### Step 1: Look at keyword difficulty

 **Keyword Difficulty (KD)** estimates how hard it will be to rank for a given
keyword somewhere in the top 10 organic search results.

Use the tool of your choice to look at the actual ""KD"" number.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-06-at-11.23.50-am.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2019-10-06-at-11.23.50-am.png)

The more you do this (with the _same_ tool), the more you will start to
understand relative difficulties.

The numbers on their own might not necessarily have any pragmatic meaning to
you at first, but the more you do it the more you will begin to get a sense of
what it takes.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-06-at-11.19.23-am.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2019-10-06-at-11.19.23-am.png)

#### Step 2: Look at Domain Rating (DR)

 **Domain Rating (DR)** is an Ahrefs measure of relative ""backlink popularity""
of your website (or your competitors' website) compared to all other websites
in their database. DR is based on a scale of 1-100 and is a logarithmic scale
(higher = stronger). It is calculated based on the # of websites linking to
the domain, and the strength of the website's backlink profile.

If the websites ranking for a certain term have a high DR, compare that to
your website to get a sense of if you are ""in the same league"" as them.

Use the SERP Overview report to quickly compare the DR of the websites ranking
for your desired term.

understand-kd-1024x392-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/serp-overview-to-understand-kd.png)

#### Step 3: Look at the URL Rating (UR)

 **URL Rating (UR)** shows the strength of the target URL's backlink profile
on a 100-point logarithmic scale. Both internal and external links influence
this metric.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-06-at-11.23.24-am.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2019-10-06-at-11.23.24-am.png)

URL rating is an excellent way to understand how many referring domains
(unique backlinks) you will need to send to your article to have a chance to
rank on Page 1.

Links are one of the most expensive parts of doing SEO, so understand this is
a very critical part of planning your SEO strategy.

Use the SERP Overview to see the UR (and RDs) of each URL that is ranking.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/using-ur-and-rd-
to-evaluate-keyword-
competition-1024x482-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/using-UR-and-RD-to-evaluate-keyword-competition.png)

#### Step 4: Check the # of SERP Results for the keyword

Understanding just how may other websites are trying to rank for a keyword is
a huge part of evaluating the competition.

 **Use Google to search the keyword and see how many results show up:**

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-06_at_12_02_51_pm.png)

As of the time writing this there are 23,900,000 search results in Google's
index that are ""relevant"" for the keyword ""keyword difficulty"".

Does this mean you are competing against 23,900,000 other people?

If you answered Yes, you are wrong.

Why not? And why did I put ""relevant"" in quotes like that?

Because here is where a little secret comes into play - not all of those are
actually relevant.

And, Google is not actually going to show all of them.

So, the next thing you can do is scroll to the bottom of the page and click
through the ""more pages"" area to see actually how many pages of results there
are (giving you a more true/accurate idea of how many results you are
competing against).

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/oct-06-2019-12-07-09.gif)

Looks like we only made it to Page 19 before Google gave up trying to give us
results.

And for good reason - look at the results on the last page, do they really
look like they would be a good resource to answer our search intent?

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-06_at_12_08_26_pm-779x1024-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen_Shot_2019-10-06_at_12_08_26_PM.png)

#### Step 5: Check the # of SERP Results for ""All in Title""

As you can see from the previous step, many of the SERP results that pulled up
are not relevant, so let's try another way to hone in on getting a more
accurate/true picture of how many actually relevant competitors there are that
we are up against.

We do this by using [advanced search
operators](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en).

The first one we will use is **"" allintitle: ""**

The allintitle operator brings back only results that have the keywords we are
using somewhere in the HTML Page Title (or exactly in order if we put quotes
around the search).

 **Use Google to search the keyword and see how many results show up:**

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-06_at_12_17_15_pm.png)

1,830 results.

Much better than ~24 million, but still quite alot of people to compete with.
We can start to see why the KDs range from 47-69.

#### Step 5: Check the # of SERP Results for ""All in URL""

The next check we want to do is see how many of these people have our keyword
in their URL.

The next operator we will use is **"" allinurl: ""**

The allinurl operator brings back only results that have the keywords we are
using somewhere in the URL (or exactly in order if we put quotes around the
search).

 **Use Google to search the keyword and see how many results show up:**

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/allinurl.png)

Okay, similar to allintitle.

Looks like we have close to 3,000 people to compete with.

#### Step 7: Look for Signs of Low Competition

After you do this for a while you start to see patterns in SERPs with low
keyword competition.

**The 3 main signs of a low competition SERP are:**

  1. Results with poor optimization (like if the title tags all look under-optimized)
  2. A lot of generic sites ranking
  3. Low-quality results (if you click on the result and it's clearly thin content & not well done)

One of the most obvious ones is when there are a lot of ""thin"" sites ranking
for terms.

For example:

  * Multiple results of the same domain ranking
  * Ezine articles
  * Youtube URLs (not the Video carousel)
  * Web 2.0s (like Blogspot, etc.)
  * eBay listings
  * Press releases
  * etc.

If you pop a keyword in a Google search and come across a SERP that has alot
of these types of websites ranking, it is a sign that you can probably rank
without too much trouble (assuming you create a quality piece of content)

#### Step 8: SERP Stability (Position History)

The next thing we want to look at is the stability of the SERP (Search Engine
Results Page).

If we see the SERP has been changing a lot, that is a clear indication that
Google is not happy with the search results - giving you an easier time to be
considered for the position of top dog.

If we look up the term ""fidget spinners"" we can see that Google is still
trying to figure out who has the best resource for that term:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-06_at_12_33_53_pm-1024x326-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen_Shot_2019-10-06_at_12_33_53_PM.png)

However, if we look up ""outreach link building"" it seems Google is quite happy
with who is ranking there - and has not changed that SERP much at all for a
very long time:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-06_at_12_34_32_pm-1024x287-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen_Shot_2019-10-06_at_12_34_32_PM.png)

This search is ""solidified"".

Good luck trying to rank for that one.

#### Step 9: Understand Your KD Baseline

This is kind of a bonus step and something you really do for your entire
website - not for every search term you are trying to evaluate the difficulty
of.

A Keyword Difficulty Baseline is a way we can answer the question ""What terms
could I expect to rank for with minimal effort based on how strong my website
is currently?""

Valid question.

For this example, let's give credit where credit is due, and use the website
of the guy I actually learned this tactic from - Robbie Richards (thanks
Robbie!)

##### How To Find Your Keyword Difficulty Baseline

 **1\. Put your website into ""Ahrefs > Site Explorer**""

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-06-at-12.52.49-pm-1024x271-1.png)

 **2\. Navigate to Organic Keywords > Sort by only the keywords on positions
1-10**

 ** _Note_** _: You can contract or expand this to understand a smaller or
wider range._

 _For example, if you want to know ""what keywords can I rank in the Top 3
spots"" you would want to sort positions 1-3, but if you want to know ""what
keywords can I get close to Page 1 pretty easily, and then maybe send a couple
links to pop onto page 1"" then you might want to filter by positions 1-15 or
1-20._

keyword-difficulty-baseline-2-1024x657-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-find-your-keyword-difficulty-baseline-2.png)

 **3\. Export your keywords**

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-to-find-your-
keyword-difficulty-baseline-3-1024x380-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-find-your-keyword-difficulty-baseline-3.png)

 **4\. Navigate to the OLD ""Ahrefs > Keywords Explorer**""

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-to-find-your-
keyword-difficulty-baseline-4-1024x271-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-find-your-keyword-difficulty-baseline-4.png)

 **5\. Add the keywords from your CSV Export back into ""Ahrefs > Keywords
Explorer"" **

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-to-find-your-
keyword-difficulty-baseline-5-1024x577-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-find-your-keyword-difficulty-baseline-5.png)

**6\. Check the ""Difficulty Distribution""**

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-to-find-your-
keyword-difficulty-baseline-6-1024x261-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-find-your-keyword-difficulty-baseline-6.png)

Voila!

You can now see all of the keywords on robbierichards.com ranking on Page 1
(aka Positions 1-10).

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-06-at-1.01.48-pm.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2019-10-06-at-1.01.48-pm.png)

This tells us that if he uncovers a new keyword he wants to rank for (assuming
its relevant to his website's theme/industry) that he could reasonably expect
to be competitive for this keyword as long as it was somewhere in the KD range
of the terms that he already ranks on Page 1 for.

The KD Baseline for Robbie is somewhere around the 41-60 mark.

## Final Thoughts

Understanding & evaluating keyword difficulty takes time and practice but is a
critical skill for creating a successful SEO strategy.

Like anything in life, you have to understand competition in order to know
what you have to focus on, and what it's going to take to achieve your goals.

The best way to get better at this stuff is to practice, and the more you do
it the faster you will get.

Eventually, evaluating KD becomes almost second nature - at this point I can
get a very clear picture of how hard something will be to rank for in just a
couple seconds, and you can too with practice.

<p><strong>Keyword difficulty</strong>  (aka  <strong>keyword</strong>   <strong>competition</strong> ) is a hugely
important metric to look at while doing keyword research &amp; creating your SEO
content strategy.</p>
<p>It essentially helps answers the question ""how hard will it be to rank for
this keyword""?</p>
<p>If you can understand how to navigate &amp; evaluate this metric you are well on
your way to ranking for all the terms you want and bringing a flood of organic
traffic to your website.</p>
<p>Each SEO tool has its own way of calculating the difficulty of a keyword, so
in this article, we will be sure to cover each of the tools you can use, but
also give you some practical advice about how to approach this hugely
important part of SEO.</p>
<p>We will give you the step-by-step method that we use to understand what is
needed to win, and also uncover some of our top-secret strategies for
evaluating the <em>true keyword competition</em> that will give you a super clear
picture of what you will need to rank above your competitors.</p>
<h2>What is Keyword Competition?</h2>
<p><strong>Keyword Competition</strong> is a term that refers to <em>how difficult it will be to
rank your website for any given keyword.</em></p>
<p>Understanding the competition of any given keyword will help guide your SEO
strategy and answer questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How hard will it be to rank for this keyword?</li>
<li>Can I legitimately compete to rank for this keyword?</li>
<li>Should I use my resources to try and rank for this keyword, or would they be better used elsewhere""?</li>
</ul>
<p>SEO Tools usually give you an indication of how competitive a keyword is using
their own proprietary metrics, and they don't all take into account all of the
factors of competition - but they usually are calculated using some
combination of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>URL Strength</strong> : How strong does your URL need to be</li>
<li><strong>Domain Strength</strong> : How strong does your Domain need to be</li>
<li><strong>URL Trust</strong> : How trustworthy does your URL need to be</li>
<li><strong>Domain Trust</strong> : How trustworthy does your Domain need to be</li>
<li><strong>Number of Links</strong> / <strong>RDs</strong> : How many links (or RDs) will you need to get to that URL</li>
<li><strong>Time</strong> : How much time it will take to rise to the top</li>
<li><strong>Popularity</strong> : Popularity of keyword (how many websites are trying to rank for this same term)</li>
<li><strong>Content Optimization</strong> : How well a piece of content is optimized for a certain keyword</li>
<li><strong>SERP Features</strong> : What (and how many) types of SERP features are taking up real estate.</li>
<li><strong>Searcher Intent</strong> : The closer you align your page to the intent of the searcher, the more you will solidify your rankings when it gets to page 1 - because people will click your link and convey the proper ""user signals"" to Google to show the algorithm what it needs to believe you do, in fact, have the best piece of content.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Keyword Competition Tools</h2>
<p>Each SEO Tool has its own proprietary way of calculating the difficulty of a
keyword, so let's start by understanding the main tools that give predictions
about keyword competition &amp; breakdown how they calculate it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ahrefs</li>
<li>SEM Rush</li>
<li>Mangools</li>
<li>Moz</li>
<li>Bonus: Other tools</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ahrefs</h3>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/ahrefs-homepage.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ahrefs-
homepage-1024x547-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Ahrefs is a very popular SEO tool that helps SEOs effectively craft an SEO
strategy, providing a ton of data on your website, your competitors' websites,
the SERP features, etc.</p>
<p>Ahrefs has the biggest keyword database on the web, with over 7.4 billion
keywords (from more than 170 countries) growing.</p>
<p>Keyword Difficulty (KD) is the term Ahrefs uses for its metrics to help you
understand how competitive a keyword/search query is.</p>
<p>Keyword Difficulty measures the competitiveness of a keyword on a scale of
1-100.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/ahrefs-keyword-difficultry.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ahrefs-keyword-
difficultry-1024x838-1.jpg"" /></a></p>
<p>Keyword difficulty essentially tells you how many <strong>referring domains you
need</strong> to your page to rank for the keyword you want.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/ahrefs-keyword-diffiicuty.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ahrefs-keyword-

<h4>Examples</h4>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/keyword-difficulty-kd-sv-on-
ahrefs.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/keyword-

company-keyword-kd-sv-on-ahrefs.png"" /></a></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ahrefs KD is our favorite metric to use to start the process of understanding the difficulty of a keyword.</li>
<li>Ahrefs KD is the most accurate <em>single</em> measurement of a Keyword's Difficulty that we have used.</li>
<li>They have a nice browser extension called the Ahrefs Bar which allows you to see a SERP Overlay to compare websites side by side easily.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ahrefs KD does not use on-page factors to determine how hard it can be to rank for a keyword.</li>
<li>Ahrefs KD shows 0 for a lot of KDs that we believe is a little...too relaxed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>SEMRush</h3>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/sem-rush-homepage.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/sem-rush-
homepage-1024x497-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Keyword Difficulty, on SEMrush, gives you an estimate of how hard it will be
to rank for your keyword from a new page on your website.</p>
<p>Like Ahrefs, their score is on a scale of 1-100.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/using-semrush-for-understanding-keyword-
competitiveness.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/using-semrush-for-
understanding-keyword-competitiveness.png"" /></a></p>
<p>The way they calculate KD must be very different though because the numbers
they pull are drastically different.</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/keyword-difficulty-kd-sv-on-sem-rush.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/keyword-

keyword-kd-sv-on-semrush.png"" /></a></p>
<h3>Moz</h3>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/using-moz-to-evaluate-keyword-difficulty-and-
competition.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/using-moz-to-
evaluate-keyword-difficulty-and-
competition-1024x609-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Moz was a very popular SEO tool, but these days I don't personally know many
people using it, simply because their crawler is not that fast and they
usually have way less websites in their database.</p>
<p>Moz has similar tools to Ahrefs &amp; SEM Rush - features like seeing the
backlinks to your page, getting information about keyword difficulty &amp; search
volume, etc.</p>
<p>They also have a nice browser extension called the Moz Bar which allows you to
see a SERP Overlay to compare websites side by side easily.</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/keyword-difficulty-kd-sv-on-
moz.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/keyword-

company-keyword-kd-sv-on-moz.png"" /></a></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>They also have a nice browser extension called the Moz Bar which allows you to see a SERP Overlay to compare websites side by side easily.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Smaller database of websites.</li>
<li>Not as accurate backlink analysis - they miss a lot of links.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Keyword Competition Tools</h3>
<p>Just for the sake of being comprehensive, I wanted to include a list of some
other tools you can use to check the difficulty/competitiveness of keywords -
plus some of these are free.</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Keyword Planner</li>
<li>SEOBook.com</li>
<li>KWFinder.com</li>
<li>SERPS.com</li>
<li>Alexa.com</li>
<li>Wordstream.com</li>
<li>Keywordtool.io</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Evaluate Keyword Competition</h2>
<p>If we compare the findings from above, you can see, each tool gives a
drastically different readout of how competitive a search term is (and even
how much search volume there is).</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2019-10-06-at-11.10.40-am.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-06-at-11.10.40-am.png"" /></a></p>
<p>So, to combat this huge disparity of tools, we like to <em>start</em> our keyword
competitiveness evaluation process by looking at metrics (truthfully we only
look at Ahrefs), and then we have some manual checks we can do to really get a
better understanding of the term.</p>
<p>The full process involves looking at a variety of data, rather than just one
metric (which we know does not take into account everything you need to rank -
because even the tools themselves say they don't factor in a lot of things
like on-page SEO.</p>
<h3>Understanding Keyword Competitiveness</h3>
<ol>
<li>Keyword Difficulty (KD)</li>
<li>Domain Rating (DR)</li>
<li>URL Rating (UR)</li>
<li>
<h1>of Results: Keyword</h1>
</li>
<li>
<h1>of Results: All in Title</h1>
</li>
<li>
<h1>of Results: All in URL</h1>
</li>
<li>Signs of Low Competition</li>
<li>SERP Stability (Position History)</li>
<li>Keyword Difficulty Baseline</li>
</ol>
<h4>Step 1: Look at keyword difficulty</h4>
<p><strong>Keyword Difficulty (KD)</strong> estimates how hard it will be to rank for a given
keyword somewhere in the top 10 organic search results.</p>
<p>Use the tool of your choice to look at the actual ""KD"" number.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2019-10-06-at-11.23.50-am.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-06-at-11.23.50-am.png"" /></a></p>
<p>The more you do this (with the <em>same</em> tool), the more you will start to
understand relative difficulties.</p>
<p>The numbers on their own might not necessarily have any pragmatic meaning to
you at first, but the more you do it the more you will begin to get a sense of
what it takes.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2019-10-06-at-11.19.23-am.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-06-at-11.19.23-am.png"" /></a></p>
<h4>Step 2: Look at Domain Rating (DR)</h4>
<p><strong>Domain Rating (DR)</strong> is an Ahrefs measure of relative ""backlink popularity""
of your website (or your competitors' website) compared to all other websites
in their database. DR is based on a scale of 1-100 and is a logarithmic scale
(higher = stronger). It is calculated based on the # of websites linking to
the domain, and the strength of the website's backlink profile.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-06-at-11.23.01-AM.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

shot-2019-10-06-at-11.23.01-am.png"" /></a></p>
<p>If the websites ranking for a certain term have a high DR, compare that to
your website to get a sense of if you are ""in the same league"" as them.</p>
<p>Use the SERP Overview report to quickly compare the DR of the websites ranking
for your desired term.</p>

<h4>Step 3: Look at the URL Rating (UR)</h4>
<p><strong>URL Rating (UR)</strong> shows the strength of the target URL's backlink profile
on a 100-point logarithmic scale. Both internal and external links influence
this metric.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2019-10-06-at-11.23.24-am.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-06-at-11.23.24-am.png"" /></a></p>
<p>URL rating is an excellent way to understand how many referring domains
(unique backlinks) you will need to send to your article to have a chance to
rank on Page 1.</p>
<p>Links are one of the most expensive parts of doing SEO, so understand this is
a very critical part of planning your SEO strategy.</p>
<p>Use the SERP Overview to see the UR (and RDs) of each URL that is ranking.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/using-UR-and-RD-to-evaluate-keyword-competition.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/using-ur-and-rd-
to-evaluate-keyword-
competition-1024x482-1.png"" /></a></p>
<h4>Step 4: Check the # of SERP Results for the keyword</h4>
<p>Understanding just how may other websites are trying to rank for a keyword is
a huge part of evaluating the competition.</p>
<p><strong>Use Google to search the keyword and see how many results show up:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-06_at_12_02_51_pm.png"" /></p>
<p>As of the time writing this there are 23,900,000 search results in Google's
index that are ""relevant"" for the keyword ""keyword difficulty"".</p>
<p>Does this mean you are competing against 23,900,000 other people?</p>
<p>If you answered Yes, you are wrong.</p>
<p>Why not? And why did I put ""relevant"" in quotes like that?</p>
<p>Because here is where a little secret comes into play - not all of those are
actually relevant.</p>
<p>And, Google is not actually going to show all of them.</p>
<p>So, the next thing you can do is scroll to the bottom of the page and click
through the ""more pages"" area to see actually how many pages of results there
are (giving you a more true/accurate idea of how many results you are
competing against).</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/oct-06-2019-12-07-09.gif"" /></p>
<p>Looks like we only made it to Page 19 before Google gave up trying to give us
results.</p>
<p>And for good reason - look at the results on the last page, do they really
look like they would be a good resource to answer our search intent?</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen_Shot_2019-10-06_at_12_08_26_PM.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-06_at_12_08_26_pm-779x1024-1.png"" /></a></p>
<h4>Step 5: Check the # of SERP Results for ""All in Title""</h4>
<p>As you can see from the previous step, many of the SERP results that pulled up
are not relevant, so let's try another way to hone in on getting a more
accurate/true picture of how many actually relevant competitors there are that
we are up against.</p>
<p>We do this by using <a href=""https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en"">advanced search
operators</a>.</p>
<p>The first one we will use is <strong>"" allintitle: ""</strong></p>
<p>The allintitle operator brings back only results that have the keywords we are
using somewhere in the HTML Page Title (or exactly in order if we put quotes
around the search).</p>
<p><strong>Use Google to search the keyword and see how many results show up:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-06_at_12_17_15_pm.png"" /></p>
<p>1,830 results.</p>
<p>Much better than ~24 million, but still quite alot of people to compete with.
We can start to see why the KDs range from 47-69.</p>
<h4>Step 5: Check the # of SERP Results for ""All in URL""</h4>
<p>The next check we want to do is see how many of these people have our keyword
in their URL.</p>
<p>The next operator we will use is <strong>"" allinurl: ""</strong></p>
<p>The allinurl operator brings back only results that have the keywords we are
using somewhere in the URL (or exactly in order if we put quotes around the
search).</p>
<p><strong>Use Google to search the keyword and see how many results show up:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/allinurl.png"" /></p>
<p>Okay, similar to allintitle.</p>
<p>Looks like we have close to 3,000 people to compete with.</p>
<h4>Step 7: Look for Signs of Low Competition</h4>
<p>After you do this for a while you start to see patterns in SERPs with low
keyword competition.</p>
<p><strong>The 3 main signs of a low competition SERP are:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Results with poor optimization (like if the title tags all look under-optimized)</li>
<li>A lot of generic sites ranking</li>
<li>Low-quality results (if you click on the result and it's clearly thin content &amp; not well done)</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the most obvious ones is when there are a lot of ""thin"" sites ranking
for terms.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple results of the same domain ranking</li>
<li>Ezine articles</li>
<li>Youtube URLs (not the Video carousel)</li>
<li>Web 2.0s (like Blogspot, etc.)</li>
<li>eBay listings</li>
<li>Press releases</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you pop a keyword in a Google search and come across a SERP that has alot
of these types of websites ranking, it is a sign that you can probably rank
without too much trouble (assuming you create a quality piece of content)</p>
<h4>Step 8: SERP Stability (Position History)</h4>
<p>The next thing we want to look at is the stability of the SERP (Search Engine
Results Page).</p>
<p>If we see the SERP has been changing a lot, that is a clear indication that
Google is not happy with the search results - giving you an easier time to be
considered for the position of top dog.</p>
<p>If we look up the term ""fidget spinners"" we can see that Google is still
trying to figure out who has the best resource for that term:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen_Shot_2019-10-06_at_12_33_53_PM.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-06_at_12_33_53_pm-1024x326-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>However, if we look up ""outreach link building"" it seems Google is quite happy
with who is ranking there - and has not changed that SERP much at all for a
very long time:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen_Shot_2019-10-06_at_12_34_32_PM.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-06_at_12_34_32_pm-1024x287-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>This search is ""solidified"".</p>
<p>Good luck trying to rank for that one.</p>
<h4>Step 9: Understand Your KD Baseline</h4>
<p>This is kind of a bonus step and something you really do for your entire
website - not for every search term you are trying to evaluate the difficulty
of.</p>
<p>A Keyword Difficulty Baseline is a way we can answer the question ""What terms
could I expect to rank for with minimal effort based on how strong my website
is currently?""</p>
<p>Valid question.</p>
<p>For this example, let's give credit where credit is due, and use the website
of the guy I actually learned this tactic from - Robbie Richards (thanks
Robbie!)</p>
<h5>How To Find Your Keyword Difficulty Baseline</h5>
<p><strong>1. Put your website into ""Ahrefs &gt; Site Explorer</strong>""</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-06-at-12.52.49-pm-1024x271-1.png"" /></p>
<p><strong>2. Navigate to Organic Keywords &gt; Sort by only the keywords on positions
1-10</strong></p>
<p>** <em>Note</em>** <em>: You can contract or expand this to understand a smaller or
wider range.</em></p>
<p><em>For example, if you want to know ""what keywords can I rank in the Top 3
spots"" you would want to sort positions 1-3, but if you want to know ""what
keywords can I get close to Page 1 pretty easily, and then maybe send a couple
links to pop onto page 1"" then you might want to filter by positions 1-15 or
1-20.</em></p>

keyword-difficulty-baseline-2-1024x657-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p><strong>3. Export your keywords</strong></p>

keyword-difficulty-baseline-3-1024x380-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p><strong>4. Navigate to the OLD ""Ahrefs &gt; Keywords Explorer</strong>""</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-find-your-keyword-difficulty-baseline-4.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-to-find-your-
keyword-difficulty-baseline-4-1024x271-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>**5. Add the keywords from your CSV Export back into ""Ahrefs &gt; Keywords
Explorer"" **</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-find-your-keyword-difficulty-baseline-5.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-to-find-your-
keyword-difficulty-baseline-5-1024x577-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p><strong>6. Check the ""Difficulty Distribution""</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-find-your-keyword-difficulty-baseline-6.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-to-find-your-
keyword-difficulty-baseline-6-1024x261-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Voila!</p>
<p>You can now see all of the keywords on robbierichards.com ranking on Page 1
(aka Positions 1-10).</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2019-10-06-at-1.01.48-pm.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-06-at-1.01.48-pm.png"" /></a></p>
<p>This tells us that if he uncovers a new keyword he wants to rank for (assuming
its relevant to his website's theme/industry) that he could reasonably expect
to be competitive for this keyword as long as it was somewhere in the KD range
of the terms that he already ranks on Page 1 for.</p>
<p>The KD Baseline for Robbie is somewhere around the 41-60 mark.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Understanding &amp; evaluating keyword difficulty takes time and practice but is a
critical skill for creating a successful SEO strategy.</p>
<p>Like anything in life, you have to understand competition in order to know
what you have to focus on, and what it's going to take to achieve your goals.</p>
<p>The best way to get better at this stuff is to practice, and the more you do
it the faster you will get.</p>
<p>Eventually, evaluating KD becomes almost second nature - at this point I can
get a very clear picture of how hard something will be to rank for in just a
couple seconds, and you can too with practice.</p>

Anytime someone searches for something in Google, that information is stored
and cataloged by Google.

Even better - Google gives us access to this information.

In other words, we can find out:

  * What people are searching
  * How they are searching for it
  * How many times those terms are being searched every month on average

We are going to draw on all the previous lessons in the SERP University
Keywords Module, and bring it all together, so make sure you have already read
the previous posts.

In this article, we are going to cover this extraordinarily important part of
SEO step-by-step and show you exactly how we approach keyword research that
has helped us to bring in millions of visitors a month for ourselves and our
clients.

If you are looking for additional / out-of-the-box ways to do keyword research
be sure to check out our other posts in the [Keywords Module of SERP
University](https://devinschumacher.com/keywords/).

 **Keyword Research Defined** : Keyword Research is the process of searching,
finding & analyzing actual search terms that users are actively searching when
looking for answers to their questions, solutions to their problems, products,
content, media, etc.

 **Keyword Research** is normally the very first step in any successful SEO
campaign.

## Why is Keyword Research Important?

For a business looking to sell more products or services, understanding
exactly what your potential customers are searching for (the verbiage they
use, the problems they have, the questions they need answers to) is an
extremely powerful way to guide the strategy of your content creation &
marketing campaigns.

It's almost like the ""What Women Want"" of SEO.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-9-1.gif)

Remember that movie? Where Mel Gibson knew what women were thinking - he could
tailor the ""marketing"" of himself exactly to what they wanted.

Keyword Research allows us (business owners/marketers) to do the same with our
audience - it tells us what they are thinking and searching, and gives us a
direct roadmap of content and messaging that we need to create to speak to
exactly what they need.

## How to Do Keyword Research

Instead of going into ALL the ways you can do keyword research, and listing
all of the possible tools and methods - we will focus on the primary ways to
get most of your work done - this is called the [80/20
Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) and it is extremely
important to keep in mind when doing keyword research.

We will go through _our process_ for doing keyword research so you can follow
along and actually make some tangible progress with your digital marketing.

Although there is no right or wrong way to do keyword research, it can quickly
turn into a bit of a [rabbit
hole](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/go+down+the+rabbit+hole).

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-10-1.gif)

So, in an effort to save you from countless hours of confusion & seemingly
never-ending research, we are going to break down **how** **we do keyword
research** that has worked for us to accomplish amazing results for our
clients SEO campaigns, like this:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/keyword-research-
susccess.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/keyword-
research-susccess.png)

### Understand Your Consumer

Before you start blinding looking for keywords you want to make sure you
understand your consumer - do your customer research and create your customer
avatars.

Fully understand the demographics, interests, etc. of who you are about to
create content for and you will have a much easier time when it comes to
making your keyword list & content strategy.

See our article on Customer Avatars & Creating a Buyer Persona for more
information.

### Understand Your Competition

A big part of doing keyword research is understanding your competition - aka
doing your competitor research.

The biggest thing to know when doing competitor research is to understand the
difference between Direct & Indirect competitors.

 **Direct competitors** are the businesses in your space that are providing
very similar products/services to the same audience you are.

 **Indirect competitors** are the businesses in your space that are not
providing competing products/services, but are taking up the attention of your
audience -and the precious and limited space on search engines for the terms
you want to rank for.

You will want to have a list of your competitors already created before you
start doing keyword research - we will reference it a lot through this
process.

### Find Keywords

Start by getting a list of keyword ideas.

We usually like to start by looking for [seed
keywords](https://devinschumacher.com/seed-keywords/) to use as topics or
""hubs"" or ""buckets"" - and then expand from there.

The goal of this section would be to come up with 5-10 topics to start with
(you can do more now, or add to them later).

#### How to Find Keywords for SEO

  * Brainstorming
  * Competitors
  * Keyword Tools

#### Use Your Existing Knowledge to Brainstorm Keyword Topics

If you know your industry you should **_start by using your existing knowledge
to brainstorm some topics & subtopics._**

For us, we are extremely familiar with SEO so when we needed to begin to think
about topics we knew a lot of these already.

Things like ""keyword research"", ""on page"", ""off page"", ""technical seo"", etc.

The same goes for your industry - if you are familiar with it you should have
a pretty good idea about the primary topics & subtopics that you can begin to
organize.

If you get stuck, you can always turn to Google.

Simply search for your industry + the word 'topic'.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/use-google-to-
start-keyword-research.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/use-google-to-start-keyword-research.png)

  * Start your keyword research using your current & existing knowledge.
  * Use Google if you need help expanding your ideas.

#### Use Your List of Competitors to Find More Topics

Using your competitors to create your keyword topics is a tried-and-true
method that we love using.

Why? Because when you analyze other companies that are already established in
your industry chances are they have done a lot of this leg work already.

Pull up your list of competitors and look at their websites to find topic
ideas.

Here is how we did this with our keyword research.

##### 1\. Pull up your competitor list

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/using-competitors-
for-keyword-research.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/using-competitors-for-keyword-research.png)

##### 2\. Navigate to some of their websites and look for topics

 **Pro tip** : Good places to look include the menu bar, services page, and
blog categories

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/find-keyword-
ideas-from-competitor-blog-
categories-1024x751-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/find-keyword-ideas-from-competitor-blog-
categories.png)

##### 3\. Add them to your Keyword list

You always want to be maintaining a list as you do keyword research.

You can use a spreadsheet, or an outlining tool like Dynalist, or a mind
mapping tool, but however, you want to do this make sure you keep track.

Build out your list with topics & sub-topics:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-07-at-12.58.22-pm.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2019-10-07-at-12.58.22-pm.png)

### Keyword Tools

The 3rd way we go about finding keywords & topics to start with is by using
keyword research tools.

Keyword tools can give you a ton of information on your topics very quickly.

After you have created your list of topics, you can expand on them using a
variety of methods that we cover here in our guide to finding [Long Tail
Keywords](https://devinschumacher.com/long-tail-keywords/#2-how-to-find-long-
tail-keywords).

 **Our #1 recommended tool for doing topical keyword research is Ahrefs.**

#### Ahrefs Competitor Keywords Overview

Plug your competitors into Ahrefs and look at their Organic Keywords.

Doing this with just one of our competitors I can already see 900+ PAGES of
keyword ideas:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/oct-07-2019-13-36-32.gif)

#### Ahrefs Top Pages

Use the ""Top Pages"" report in Ahrefs to see what pages are bringing your
competitors their traffic:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-07_at_1_01_25_pm-1024x795-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen_Shot_2019-10-07_at_1_01_25_PM.png)

#### Ahrefs Keyword Explorer

Simply type your main ""industry"" or topic into ""Ahrefs > Keywords Explorer"" &
use the options in the ""Keyword Ideas"" sidebar to see an almost endless amount
of ideas:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-07_at_1_05_46_pm-1024x789-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen_Shot_2019-10-07_at_1_05_46_PM.png)

Yes, a lot of the keywords won't make any sense but spend a few minutes
scrolling through the pages and you will get ideas to work with.

Here are some of the keyword ideas that stuck out in just a few short minutes
of looking through these results:

  * SEO tools
  * SEO training
  * SEO services
  * SEO audit
  * SEO software
  * SEO analysis
  * White hat SEO
  * SEO techniques
  * How does SEO work

 **Pro Tip** : Easily expand off of these primary topics by clicking into one,
check what URLs are ranking, and then look at the _other keywords_ those URLs
rank for.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/oct-07-2019-13-16-41.gif)

### Analyze & Understand Keywords

#### Metrics

Use a tool (like Ahrefs or Google Keyword Planner) to find and note the
**search volume & [keyword difficulty](https://devinschumacher.com/keyword-
difficulty/)** for each keyword.

Obviously targeting keywords with HIGHER search volume and LOWER difficulty is
a good start point for creating a strategy to drive organic traffic to your
website.

 **Pro Tip** : Use a spreadsheet function to automatically color the SV
(search volume) and KD (keyword difficulty) columns so you can easily see
where the opportunities lie.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-07-at-1.41.14-pm.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2019-10-07-at-1.41.14-pm.png)

#### Relevance

Keyword relevance is a major part of developing a good SEO strategy from your
keyword research phase.

Make sure you trim out / ignore keywords that are not relevant.

#### Intent

Intent (aka ""search intent"", ""keyword intent"", etc.) refers to the state of
mind and the desired outcome that the searcher has.

We cover this in detail in a previous lesson about [SEO
Keywords](https://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud-keywords/), so you
should already be familiar with this - but the intent of a keyword will have a
huge impact on the profitability / ROI you will get by ranking for that term.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-07-at-2.20.23-pm.png)

#### Modifiers

Keyword modifiers are prefixes, suffixes, etc. that can be very beneficial to
your business and profitability of ranking for a keyword.

They are the additional words (like you see in the above image) that change
the intent of the keyword.

For example, in our article ""how to choose an SEO company"" we also want to
rank for this term with the modifiers (adjectives) good, best, top, etc.

So, we include that in your keyword research + planning.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-07-at-2.25.28-pm-1-1024x108-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-07-at-2.25.28-PM-1.png)

#### Variations

Keyword variations are essentially different ways of saying the same thing.

This goes back to intent.

For example, if I am looking for ""business cards for lawyers"" I might search
""lawyer business cards"" or ""attorney business cards"".

The intent is the same.

Google is getting better about understanding this, but it still helps to rank
for all the keyword variations by putting them on your webpage - so be sure to
keep an eye out for them during your keyword research phase and add them to
your list.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-07-at-2.25.03-pm-1-1024x243-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-07-at-2.25.03-PM-1.png)

### Map Keywords

Once you have landed on a list of keywords that you want to build it's
important that you map them to URLs on your website - these can be existing
URLs or pages you plan to build, but either way, you want to match up keywords
to URLs on your sitemap.

 **Remember** : A sitemap is simply a list of all the URLs on your website.

Mapping keywords to URLs helps you:

  * Keep your website organized
  * Plan the order in which you will start creating your content
  * Avoid having multiple pages on your website optimized for the same keywords (very important)

The best way to start mapping keywords to URLs is with SERP App - a free
application that allows you to better manage your SEO & digital presence
online.

 **Step 1** : Sign up for [SERP App](https://serp.app)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-07-at-2.08.13-pm-1024x553-1.png)

 **Step 2** : Add your ""Project""

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-

benefit of rank tracking, uptime monitoring, optimization tips, etc.

<p>Anytime someone searches for something in Google, that information is stored
and cataloged by Google.</p>
<p>Even better - Google gives us access to this information.</p>
<p>In other words, we can find out:</p>
<ul>
<li>What people are searching</li>
<li>How they are searching for it</li>
<li>How many times those terms are being searched every month on average</li>
</ul>
<p>We are going to draw on all the previous lessons in the SERP University
Keywords Module, and bring it all together, so make sure you have already read
the previous posts.</p>

<p><strong>Keyword Research Defined</strong> : Keyword Research is the process of searching,
finding &amp; analyzing actual search terms that users are actively searching when
looking for answers to their questions, solutions to their problems, products,
content, media, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Keyword Research</strong> is normally the very first step in any successful SEO
campaign.</p>
<h2>Why is Keyword Research Important?</h2>
<p>For a business looking to sell more products or services, understanding
exactly what your potential customers are searching for (the verbiage they
use, the problems they have, the questions they need answers to) is an
extremely powerful way to guide the strategy of your content creation &amp;
marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>It's almost like the ""What Women Want"" of SEO.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-9-1.gif"" /></p>
<p>Remember that movie? Where Mel Gibson knew what women were thinking - he could
tailor the ""marketing"" of himself exactly to what they wanted.</p>
<p>Keyword Research allows us (business owners/marketers) to do the same with our
audience - it tells us what they are thinking and searching, and gives us a
direct roadmap of content and messaging that we need to create to speak to
exactly what they need.</p>
<h2>How to Do Keyword Research</h2>
<p>Instead of going into ALL the ways you can do keyword research, and listing
all of the possible tools and methods - we will focus on the primary ways to
get most of your work done - this is called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle"">80/20
Rule</a> and it is extremely
important to keep in mind when doing keyword research.</p>
<p>We will go through <em>our process</em> for doing keyword research so you can follow
along and actually make some tangible progress with your digital marketing.</p>
<p>Although there is no right or wrong way to do keyword research, it can quickly
turn into a bit of a <a href=""https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/go+down+the+rabbit+hole"">rabbit
hole</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-10-1.gif"" /></p>
<p>So, in an effort to save you from countless hours of confusion &amp; seemingly
never-ending research, we are going to break down <strong>how</strong> <strong>we do keyword
research</strong> that has worked for us to accomplish amazing results for our
clients SEO campaigns, like this:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/keyword-
research-susccess.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/keyword-research-
susccess.png"" /></a></p>
<h3>Understand Your Consumer</h3>
<p>Before you start blinding looking for keywords you want to make sure you
understand your consumer - do your customer research and create your customer
avatars.</p>
<p>Fully understand the demographics, interests, etc. of who you are about to
create content for and you will have a much easier time when it comes to
making your keyword list &amp; content strategy.</p>
<p>See our article on Customer Avatars &amp; Creating a Buyer Persona for more
information.</p>
<h3>Understand Your Competition</h3>
<p>A big part of doing keyword research is understanding your competition - aka
doing your competitor research.</p>
<p>The biggest thing to know when doing competitor research is to understand the
difference between Direct &amp; Indirect competitors.</p>
<p><strong>Direct competitors</strong> are the businesses in your space that are providing
very similar products/services to the same audience you are.</p>
<p><strong>Indirect competitors</strong> are the businesses in your space that are not
providing competing products/services, but are taking up the attention of your
audience -and the precious and limited space on search engines for the terms
you want to rank for.</p>
<p>You will want to have a list of your competitors already created before you
start doing keyword research - we will reference it a lot through this
process.</p>
<h3>Find Keywords</h3>
<p>Start by getting a list of keyword ideas.</p>
<p>We usually like to start by looking for <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/seed-keywords/"">seed
keywords</a> to use as topics or
""hubs"" or ""buckets"" - and then expand from there.</p>
<p>The goal of this section would be to come up with 5-10 topics to start with
(you can do more now, or add to them later).</p>
<h4>How to Find Keywords for SEO</h4>
<ul>
<li>Brainstorming</li>
<li>Competitors</li>
<li>Keyword Tools</li>
</ul>
<h4>Use Your Existing Knowledge to Brainstorm Keyword Topics</h4>
<p>If you know your industry you should <strong><em>start by using your existing knowledge
to brainstorm some topics &amp; subtopics.</em></strong></p>
<p>For us, we are extremely familiar with SEO so when we needed to begin to think
about topics we knew a lot of these already.</p>
<p>Things like ""keyword research"", ""on page"", ""off page"", ""technical seo"", etc.</p>
<p>The same goes for your industry - if you are familiar with it you should have
a pretty good idea about the primary topics &amp; subtopics that you can begin to
organize.</p>
<p>If you get stuck, you can always turn to Google.</p>
<p>Simply search for your industry + the word 'topic'.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/use-google-to-start-keyword-research.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/use-google-to-
start-keyword-research.png"" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Start your keyword research using your current &amp; existing knowledge.</li>
<li>Use Google if you need help expanding your ideas.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Use Your List of Competitors to Find More Topics</h4>
<p>Using your competitors to create your keyword topics is a tried-and-true
method that we love using.</p>
<p>Why? Because when you analyze other companies that are already established in
your industry chances are they have done a lot of this leg work already.</p>
<p>Pull up your list of competitors and look at their websites to find topic
ideas.</p>
<p>Here is how we did this with our keyword research.</p>
<h5>1. Pull up your competitor list</h5>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/using-competitors-for-keyword-research.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/using-competitors-
for-keyword-research.png"" /></a></p>
<h5>2. Navigate to some of their websites and look for topics</h5>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong> : Good places to look include the menu bar, services page, and
blog categories</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/find-keyword-ideas-from-competitor-blog-
categories.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/find-keyword-
ideas-from-competitor-blog-
categories-1024x751-1.png"" /></a></p>
<h5>3. Add them to your Keyword list</h5>
<p>You always want to be maintaining a list as you do keyword research.</p>
<p>You can use a spreadsheet, or an outlining tool like Dynalist, or a mind
mapping tool, but however, you want to do this make sure you keep track.</p>
<p>Build out your list with topics &amp; sub-topics:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2019-10-07-at-12.58.22-pm.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-07-at-12.58.22-pm.png"" /></a></p>
<h3>Keyword Tools</h3>
<p>The 3rd way we go about finding keywords &amp; topics to start with is by using
keyword research tools.</p>
<p>Keyword tools can give you a ton of information on your topics very quickly.</p>
<p>After you have created your list of topics, you can expand on them using a
variety of methods that we cover here in our guide to finding <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/long-tail-keywords/#2-how-to-find-long-
tail-keywords"">Long Tail
Keywords</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Our #1 recommended tool for doing topical keyword research is Ahrefs.</strong></p>
<h4>Ahrefs Competitor Keywords Overview</h4>
<p>Plug your competitors into Ahrefs and look at their Organic Keywords.</p>
<p>Doing this with just one of our competitors I can already see 900+ PAGES of
keyword ideas:</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/oct-07-2019-13-36-32.gif"" /></p>
<h4>Ahrefs Top Pages</h4>
<p>Use the ""Top Pages"" report in Ahrefs to see what pages are bringing your
competitors their traffic:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen_Shot_2019-10-07_at_1_01_25_PM.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-07_at_1_01_25_pm-1024x795-1.png"" /></a></p>
<h4>Ahrefs Keyword Explorer</h4>
<p>Simply type your main ""industry"" or topic into ""Ahrefs &gt; Keywords Explorer"" &amp;
use the options in the ""Keyword Ideas"" sidebar to see an almost endless amount
of ideas:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen_Shot_2019-10-07_at_1_05_46_PM.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-07_at_1_05_46_pm-1024x789-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Yes, a lot of the keywords won't make any sense but spend a few minutes
scrolling through the pages and you will get ideas to work with.</p>
<p>Here are some of the keyword ideas that stuck out in just a few short minutes
of looking through these results:</p>
<ul>
<li>SEO tools</li>
<li>SEO training</li>
<li>SEO services</li>
<li>SEO audit</li>
<li>SEO software</li>
<li>SEO analysis</li>
<li>White hat SEO</li>
<li>SEO techniques</li>
<li>How does SEO work</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong> : Easily expand off of these primary topics by clicking into one,
check what URLs are ranking, and then look at the <em>other keywords</em> those URLs
rank for.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/oct-07-2019-13-16-41.gif"" /></p>
<h3>Analyze &amp; Understand Keywords</h3>
<h4>Metrics</h4>
<p>Use a tool (like Ahrefs or Google Keyword Planner) to find and note the
<strong>search volume &amp; <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/keyword-
difficulty/"">keyword difficulty</a></strong> for each keyword.</p>
<p>Obviously targeting keywords with HIGHER search volume and LOWER difficulty is
a good start point for creating a strategy to drive organic traffic to your
website.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong> : Use a spreadsheet function to automatically color the SV
(search volume) and KD (keyword difficulty) columns so you can easily see
where the opportunities lie.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2019-10-07-at-1.41.14-pm.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-07-at-1.41.14-pm.png"" /></a></p>
<h4>Relevance</h4>
<p>Keyword relevance is a major part of developing a good SEO strategy from your
keyword research phase.</p>
<p>Make sure you trim out / ignore keywords that are not relevant.</p>
<h4>Intent</h4>
<p>Intent (aka ""search intent"", ""keyword intent"", etc.) refers to the state of
mind and the desired outcome that the searcher has.</p>
<p>We cover this in detail in a previous lesson about <a href=""https://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud-keywords/"">SEO
Keywords</a>, so you
should already be familiar with this - but the intent of a keyword will have a
huge impact on the profitability / ROI you will get by ranking for that term.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-07-at-2.20.23-pm.png"" /></p>
<h4>Modifiers</h4>
<p>Keyword modifiers are prefixes, suffixes, etc. that can be very beneficial to
your business and profitability of ranking for a keyword.</p>
<p>They are the additional words (like you see in the above image) that change
the intent of the keyword.</p>
<p>For example, in our article ""how to choose an SEO company"" we also want to
rank for this term with the modifiers (adjectives) good, best, top, etc.</p>
<p>So, we include that in your keyword research + planning.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-07-at-2.25.28-PM-1.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-07-at-2.25.28-pm-1-1024x108-1.png"" /></a></p>
<h4>Variations</h4>
<p>Keyword variations are essentially different ways of saying the same thing.</p>
<p>This goes back to intent.</p>
<p>For example, if I am looking for ""business cards for lawyers"" I might search
""lawyer business cards"" or ""attorney business cards"".</p>
<p>The intent is the same.</p>
<p>Google is getting better about understanding this, but it still helps to rank
for all the keyword variations by putting them on your webpage - so be sure to
keep an eye out for them during your keyword research phase and add them to
your list.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

shot-2019-10-07-at-2.25.03-pm-1-1024x243-1.png"" /></a></p>
<h3>Map Keywords</h3>
<p>Once you have landed on a list of keywords that you want to build it's
important that you map them to URLs on your website - these can be existing
URLs or pages you plan to build, but either way, you want to match up keywords
to URLs on your sitemap.</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong> : A sitemap is simply a list of all the URLs on your website.</p>
<p>Mapping keywords to URLs helps you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep your website organized</li>
<li>Plan the order in which you will start creating your content</li>
<li>Avoid having multiple pages on your website optimized for the same keywords (very important)</li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to start mapping keywords to URLs is with SERP App - a free
application that allows you to better manage your SEO &amp; digital presence
online.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> : Sign up for <a href=""https://serp.app"">SERP App</a></p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong> : Add your ""Project""</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-

<p><strong>Step 3</strong> : Add URLs + Keywords</p>

To understand what meta keywords are, you must first know what a ""meta tag"" in
HTML is.

""Google supports both page-level meta-tags as well as inline directives to
help control how your site's pages will appear in Search. Page-level meta tags
are a great way for webmasters to provide search engines with information
about their sites. Meta tags can be used to provide information to all sorts
of clients, and each system processes only the meta tags they understand and
ignores the rest. Meta tags are added to the `<head>` section of your HTML
page and generally look like this""

    
    
    <!DOCTYPE html><html>  <head>    <meta charset=""utf-8"">    <meta name=""Description"" CONTENT=""Author: A.N. Author, Illustrator: P. Picture, Category: Books, Price:  £9.24, Length: 784 pages"">    <meta name=""google-site-verification"" content=""+nxGUDJ4QpAZ5l9Bsjdi102tLVC21AIh5d1Nl23908vVuFHs34=""/>    <title>Example Books - high-quality used books for children</title>    <meta name=""robots"" content=""noindex,nofollow"">

(Source: [Google](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/79812?hl=en))

A ""meta tag"" is a piece of HTML code that is written ""behind the scenes"" of a
website.

They are not seen by humans on the front end of the website, but rather they
are code that makes up the entirety of the web page and provides additional
information about the page to search engines - like the topic, etc.

 **Meta Keywords** are a specific type of HTML ""meta tag"" that used to be used
to give search engines a list of keywords that the page was about. Meta
keywords help to provide additional context & clarity on the topic of your
page so that a search engine would know whether or not to provide your page as
a resource for certain searches.

## How Are Meta Keywords Used?

Google's official stance is that now (actually as of 2009) they no longer look
at the meta keywords are anymore. They do not use it as a search engine
ranking, and so for all intents & purposes, it is deprecated.

 **Full Disclaimer** : You now know that Google does not use meta keywords
anymore and that you can pretty much ignore them, so if you want to stop
reading and move on to the next post that is more than okay. However, if you
just want to learn more about what they are so you have that background
knowledge - keep reading.

If we were to add Meta Keywords to this page we would add a line of HTML code
to the webpage using some of the keywords we found while doing keyword
research for this article, and it would look something like this:

### Meta Keywords Tag Example:

    
    
    <meta name=""keywords"" content=""meta keywords, meta keyword tags in seo, how to use meta keywords, meta keyword importance"">

In reality, we do not use Meta Keywords.

## Best Practices with Meta Information

There are other types of Meta Tags that can be used in SEO. Things that you
specifically ""mark up"" on your page to tell search engines things like the
""Title of the Page"", the main topic (aka ""Heading 1"") and even sub-topics that
you broke the page into (Heading 2s, Heading 3s, etc.)

These are still very legitimate [SEO ranking
factors](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/) and should be
used in your SEO strategy, but as for **Meta Keywords the consensus is: Don't
Do it**.

## Can Meta Keyword Tags Hurt Your SEO?

Google representatives had said on multiple occasions that they do nothing.
They will not help, nor will they hurt your website's SEO Rankings.

However, I wouldn't roll the dice.

Google has been known to publish misinformation all the time.

I'm seriously not sure if their webspam team actually knows the answers and
intentionally releases bad information, or if they actually don't know what
they are talking about because they don't do SEO on a daily basis.

I would be safe and just avoid adding the meta keywords tag.

Use the other meta tags (like Page Title, etc.) but avoid this one.

Well, that was one right there.

They are typically questions, full sentences, or well-thought-out (specific)
search queries.

Normally, **long-tail keywords** are more specific than short-tail keywords
because the more words you put into a search query the (typically) less
confusion there is about what it is you want exactly.

  * Longtail keywords typical are more valuable because of their high purchase intent
  * Longtail keywords are also very interesting because there are way more of them (according to Ahrefs, 92% of all keywords that people type into search engines are long tails).

Targeting long tail keywords is an amazing way to crack into highly
competitive industries because even though they are very specific (and
typically carry more purchase intent) they are normally not as difficult to
rank for.

If you are looking to increase super-relevant search traffic to your website
and sell more products/services (even if you are in a competitive niche) than
you will want to pay close attention to **long tail keywords**.

## What Are Long Tail Keywords

 **Long Tail Keywords Definition** : Long Tail (aka longtail or long-tail)
Keywords are simply keywords or (or in this case key-phrases and even
sentences) that people type into a search engine that usually consist of 3-4+
words.

Longtail keywords are usually made from taking a [seed
keyword](https://devinschumacher.com/seed-keywords/) and adding more words to
the search query to get specific about what you want.

## Why Are Longtail Keywords Important for SEO?

For example, if someone were to go to Google and search ""t-shirts"" what are
they looking for exactly?

Are they looking to buy t-shirts or design t-shirts? Are they looking for
t-shirts for men or women? Are they looking for someone who sells t-shirts
locally, or do they want to find online sellers? Do they want a blank t-shirt
or a specific brand?

There's no way to know.

But, if that same person searches ""blue american apparel t-shirts"" the
_intent_ behind that search is much more specific.

""blue american apparel t-shirts"" would be an example of a **long tail keyword
search** , whereas ""t-shirts"" would be an example of a ""head"" or ""seed""
keyword search.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/long-tail-
keywords-graph-1024x926-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/long-tail-keywords-graph.png)source: backlinko

Because long-tails are more specific they usually have less search volume:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/sv-of-long-tails-
vs-short-tails.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/sv-of-long-tails-vs-short-tails.png)

However, there are **way more long tail keywords** than short ones.

For example, there are only 2 ways to write t shirts:

  1. t shirts
  2. t-shirts

But how many ways can you search for t-shirts when adding more words (aka how
many more keywords are there when you start looking for longtails)?

 **The answer is 513,934 more keywords** :

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/t_shirts_long_tail_searches-875x1024-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/t_shirts_long_tail_searches.png)

Now do you see why your keyword research strategy & content plan need to
incorporate long-tail keywords?!

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/long-tail-
keywords-make-up-majority-of-
searches-929x1024-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/long-tail-keywords-make-up-majority-of-searches.png)  
source: Hitwise

Long tail keywords make up the majority of searches.

Use this to your advantage.

Because especially when you are starting out, long-tail keywords are where the
money is.

 **To Summarize:**

  * Longtail keywords are less competitive than shorter keywords
  * Longtail keywords have a higher purchase intent
  * Longtail keywords convert better

## How to Find Long Tail Keywords

  2. Google Auto-complete

  4. Google ""Searches Related To""
  5. Answer The Public

  7. Google ""People also ask""

  11. Answer The Public
  12. Forums
  13. Online Q&A Sites
  14. Social Groups
  15. Longtail Keyword Tools
  16. Soovle

We will cover all these ways listed above to find longtail keywords, but to be
honest you don't need to use them all.

We recommend you stick to the top 3-5 to start, and if you need more then you
can venture down the list.

### Ahrefs Phrase Match

Ahrefs phrase match is the easiest way to turn a [seed
keyword](https://devinschumacher.com/seed-keywords/) into a ton of long tail
kewyords that you can incorporate into your content plan.

1\. Go to Ahrefs > Keyword Explorer > Enter your seed keyword > Select ""phrase
match""

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/long-tail-
kewyords-using-ahrefs-phrase-
match-1024x866-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/long-tail-kewyords-using-ahrefs-phrase-match.png)

Scroll through to your hearts content!

### Google Auto-complete

Google autocomplete is one of our top ways to get ideas for keywords.

1\. Go to Google > Enter your seed keyword

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-04-at-6.46.55-pm.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2019-10-04-at-6.46.55-pm.png)

One thing to notice about Google auto-complete is that you will get different
results every time you modify your search.

So, if you start with ""vitamins "" you will get the list shown above.

But, if you start typing the letter a next, as in ""vitamins a"" you will get an
autocomplete list of terms people use that begin with ""vitamins a"". And that
works for other letters as well.

using-google-autocomplete-1.png)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/longtail-search-
using-google-autocomplete-2.png)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/longtail-search-

using-google-autocomplete-2.png)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/longtail-search-
using-google-autocomplete-3.png)

And if by this time the ideas still aren't flowing, I recommend trying some
obvious words.

**For example, ""vitamins for "":**

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/longtail-search-
using-google-autocomplete-4.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/longtail-search-using-google-autocomplete-4.png)

The more combinations of words / letters that you try the more ideas you will
get for long tail keywords.

### Competitor Sitemaps

Competitor sitemaps are a very cool ""hack"" that you can use to get ideas for
content (and long tail keywords).

This method simply involves being able to see all the URLs on your
competitor's website.

1\. Choose a competitor > Enter their URL into [Screaming
Frog](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/) > Filter by HTML (or export
to CSV) > Look through the URLs (and Page Titles)

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/longtail-keywords-
by-competitors.gif)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/longtail-keywords-by-competitors.gif)

### Google ""Searches Related To""

Google will give you other ideas for searches based on similar things that
people search in relation to the keyword you use.

So, if you start with vitamins (or any other search) and scroll down to the
bottom of the SERP, you will see this box:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/longtail_keyword_research_using_searches_related_to_1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/longtail_keyword_research_using_searches_related_to_1.png)

And if those aren't enough ideas, just click on one and then scroll down to
the bottom of the next SERP:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/longtail_keyword_research_using_searches_related_to_2.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/longtail_keyword_research_using_searches_related_to_2.png)

### Answer The Public

Answer the Public is a cool website (that helps you get ideas for longtail
keywords) with some crazy old dude on the homepage yelling at you.

What could be better than that?

Let's search ""vitamins"" again:

### Keywords Everywhere

One cool way to ""amplify"" the Google ""searches related to"" method is using a
chrome extension called Keywords Everywhere.

When enabled, it will give you a ton more ideas of keywords based on the one
you searched.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/long-tail-keyword-

everywhere-859x1024-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/long-tail-keyword-research-using-keywords-

It used to be free, but it looks like they are moving it to a paid tool now.

### Google ""People also ask""

The ""People also ask"" part of Google is tending to show up more and more on
the SERPs.

You've seen them before.

They are questions that other searches that people also use related to the
keyword search you used.

For example, if you search ""vitamins"" and scroll down just a bit you will see
this ""people also ask"" area - giving you even more long-tail keyword search
ideas:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/longtail-kw-

ask-1024x916-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/longtail-KW-search-ideas-using-googles-people-also-
ask.png)

If you start clicking on them, you get an essentially infinite number of new
ideas:

searches-using-people-also-ask.gif)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/longtail-keyword-searches-using-people-also-ask.gif)

### Wonder Search

Wonder Search is a free keyword tool that collects keyword terms that are
semantically related to your seed keyword.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/wonder-search-
ch-1024x653-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/wonder-search-ch.png)

Basically, you enter a keyword and get a big list of those ""People also ask""
type keywords.

However, at the time of writing this, it seems they are having problems so I
can't show you an example.

#WonderSearchFail

### Google Search Console

Google Search Console ""Performance report"" shows you keywords that your
website is showing up for somewhere on Google's index.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/using-google-
search-concsole-to-find-long-tail-keywords.gif)

### Google Trends

Google Trends is a tool that allows you to see interest related to a search
term over time, so you know if the topic you are researching is growing or
shrinking in consumer interest.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/using-google-

research-1024x536-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

It looks like the interest for ""long tail keywords"" is on the rise .. kinda.

### Forums

Forums are goldmines for getting a pulse on your audience.

It's a place dedicated for questions and answers - and the people posting in
them are obviously die hard enough to signup and have conversations.

We highly recommend making a list of forums and taking a few hours (or ideally
even days) going through and seeing what kind of pain points your audience has
- these are issues you can create content around and help give people answers.

If they are asking these questions in forums it means one of 3 things:

  1. They couldn't find the answers on Google
  2. They don't trust the answers on Google
  3. The answers on Google don't work

A perfect opportunity for you to slide in to help people and make some sales:
win-win!

 **Start by searching for forums:**

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/using-long-tail-
keywords-to-find-fprums-1024x912-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/using-long-tail-keywords-to-find-fprums.png)

Scroll through the topics and get instant ideas for content (and also people
you can contact to start engaging & potentially drum up some interest in your
products/services)

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/using-long-tail-

content/uploads/2019/10/using-long-tail-keywords-to-find-fprums-2.png)

### Online Q&A Sites

Online Q&A sites are like forums, but a little more accessible.

They are places where people ask questions - and another amazing place for you
to find some long tail keyword & content ideas.

 **Here are some of the popular Q &A sites you can search through:**

  * Quora
  * Yahoo Answers
  * Woofresh
  * Reddit
  * Does anybody else…?
  * Explain me Like I'm Five
  * Ask Science
  * Ask Historians
  * Ask Culinary
  * Answers
  * Tip of my tongue
  * AskOpinion
  * Kuora
  * Yahoo Answers
  * Answers
  * Questions2Answer

The premise is the same: Search your keyword > Look at what people are asking
(use these as keyword ideas).

 **Pro-tip** : After you begin creating content you can go back to these sites
& have conversations with people and link them to the resource you made on the
topic.

### Social Groups

Use social groups like you use Forums and Q&A sites.

  1. Join Groups > See what people are asking questions about > Get ideas for keywords & content pieces
  2. Write your content
  3. Go back to the groups & engage in conversations with people and link to your helpful resources

### Soovle

Soovle is a website that gives you search suggestions & auto0completions from
the top providers on the internet.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/using-soovle-for-
longtail-keyword-research-1024x366-1.png)

As soon as I run my search (sticking with the example of ""vitamins"") you start
seing the autocomplete information from all the different search engines
pictured above:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/using-soovle-for-

of these are paid, but feel free to explore them and have a little fun
learning new stuff!

  * Ahrefs

## How to Use Long Tail Keywords

 **1\. Create a piece of content optimized around the longtail keyword**

We deployed this strategy for one of our clients and you can see that the long
tail keyword pieces of content we created are actually their Top Pages!

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-to-use-long-
tail-keywords-1-1024x638-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-use-long-tail-keywords-1.png)

 **2\. Add longtail keywords into your articles (if they are semantic
keywords, LSI keywords, or supporting keywords)**

Adding longtail keywords (semantic, LSI & supporting) helps build the breadth
& comprehensiveness of your article.

They help make your content a super valuable resource that will answer
questions thoroughly but also help with SEO because they add additional
keywords which allow your article to rank for so many more phrases that can
bring you search volume.

Here is an example from one of our clients where we created a big article
around the seed keyword ""essential oils guide"" but ended up indexing for a ton
of additional longer tail keywords.

You can see from the screenshot that by deploying this correctly, you can turn
an article that was built around one seed term (essential oils guide) into an
article that ranks for 160+ keywords!

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-to-use-long-
tail-keywords-2-1024x235-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-use-long-tail-keywords-2.png)

3\. Use long-tail keywords as your ""cluster content"" pieces that bolster &
link back to your pillar pieces of content

## Final Thoughts

  * Longtail keywords can power your content strategy to increase website traffic & sales. 
  * Longtail keywords are easier to rank for and carry more purchase intent.

<p>""blue american apparel t-shirts"" would be an example of a <strong>long tail keyword
search</strong> , whereas ""t-shirts"" would be an example of a ""head"" or ""seed""
keyword search.</p>

keywords-graph-1024x926-1.png"" /></a>source: backlinko</p>
<p>Because long-tails are more specific they usually have less search volume:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

vs-short-tails.png"" /></a></p>
<p>However, there are <strong>way more long tail keywords</strong> than short ones.</p>
<p>For example, there are only 2 ways to write t shirts:</p>
<ol>
<li>t shirts</li>
<li>t-shirts</li>
</ol>
<p>But how many ways can you search for t-shirts when adding more words (aka how
many more keywords are there when you start looking for longtails)?</p>
<p><strong>The answer is 513,934 more keywords</strong> :</p>

<p>Now do you see why your keyword research strategy &amp; content plan need to
incorporate long-tail keywords?!</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

source: Hitwise</p>
<p>Long tail keywords make up the majority of searches.</p>
<p>Use this to your advantage.</p>
<p>Because especially when you are starting out, long-tail keywords are where the
money is.</p>
<p><strong>To Summarize:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Longtail keywords are less competitive than shorter keywords</li>
<li>Longtail keywords have a higher purchase intent</li>
<li>Longtail keywords convert better</li>
</ul>

</ol>
<p>We will cover all these ways listed above to find longtail keywords, but to be
honest you don't need to use them all.</p>
<p>We recommend you stick to the top 3-5 to start, and if you need more then you
can venture down the list.</p>
<h3>Ahrefs Phrase Match</h3>
<p>Ahrefs phrase match is the easiest way to turn a <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/seed-keywords/"">seed
keyword</a> into a ton of long tail
kewyords that you can incorporate into your content plan.</p>
<p>1. Go to Ahrefs &gt; Keyword Explorer &gt; Enter your seed keyword &gt; Select ""phrase
match""</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/long-tail-kewyords-using-ahrefs-phrase-match.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/long-tail-
kewyords-using-ahrefs-phrase-
match-1024x866-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Scroll through to your hearts content!</p>
<h3>Google Auto-complete</h3>
<p>Google autocomplete is one of our top ways to get ideas for keywords.</p>
<p>1. Go to Google &gt; Enter your seed keyword</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2019-10-04-at-6.46.55-pm.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-04-at-6.46.55-pm.png"" /></a></p>
<p>One thing to notice about Google auto-complete is that you will get different
results every time you modify your search.</p>
<p>So, if you start with ""vitamins "" you will get the list shown above.</p>
<p>But, if you start typing the letter a next, as in ""vitamins a"" you will get an
autocomplete list of terms people use that begin with ""vitamins a"". And that
works for other letters as well.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/longtail-search-
using-google-autocomplete-1.png"" /></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/longtail-search-
using-google-autocomplete-2.png"" /></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/longtail-search-
using-google-autocomplete-3.png"" /></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/longtail-search-
using-google-autocomplete-1.png"" /></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/longtail-search-
using-google-autocomplete-2.png"" /></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/longtail-search-
using-google-autocomplete-3.png"" /></p>
<p>And if by this time the ideas still aren't flowing, I recommend trying some
obvious words.</p>
<p><strong>For example, ""vitamins for "":</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/longtail-search-using-google-autocomplete-4.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/longtail-search-
using-google-autocomplete-4.png"" /></a></p>
<p>The more combinations of words / letters that you try the more ideas you will
get for long tail keywords.</p>
<h3>Competitor Sitemaps</h3>
<p>Competitor sitemaps are a very cool ""hack"" that you can use to get ideas for
content (and long tail keywords).</p>
<p>This method simply involves being able to see all the URLs on your
competitor's website.</p>
<p>1. Choose a competitor &gt; Enter their URL into <a href=""https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/"">Screaming
Frog</a> &gt; Filter by HTML (or export
to CSV) &gt; Look through the URLs (and Page Titles)</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/longtail-keywords-by-competitors.gif""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/longtail-keywords-
by-competitors.gif"" /></a></p>
<h3>Google ""Searches Related To""</h3>
<p>Google will give you other ideas for searches based on similar things that
people search in relation to the keyword you use.</p>
<p>So, if you start with vitamins (or any other search) and scroll down to the
bottom of the SERP, you will see this box:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/longtail_keyword_research_using_searches_related_to_1.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/longtail_keyword_research_using_searches_related_to_1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>And if those aren't enough ideas, just click on one and then scroll down to
the bottom of the next SERP:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/longtail_keyword_research_using_searches_related_to_2.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/longtail_keyword_research_using_searches_related_to_2.png"" /></a></p>
<h3>Answer The Public</h3>
<p>Answer the Public is a cool website (that helps you get ideas for longtail
keywords) with some crazy old dude on the homepage yelling at you.</p>
<p>What could be better than that?</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

<p>Let's search ""vitamins"" again:</p>

<h3>Keywords Everywhere</h3>
<p>One cool way to ""amplify"" the Google ""searches related to"" method is using a
chrome extension called Keywords Everywhere.</p>
<p>When enabled, it will give you a ton more ideas of keywords based on the one
you searched.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/long-tail-keyword-research-using-keywords-

research-using-keywords-
everywhere-859x1024-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>It used to be free, but it looks like they are moving it to a paid tool now.</p>

<h3>Google ""People also ask""</h3>
<p>The ""People also ask"" part of Google is tending to show up more and more on
the SERPs.</p>
<p>You've seen them before.</p>
<p>They are questions that other searches that people also use related to the
keyword search you used.</p>
<p>For example, if you search ""vitamins"" and scroll down just a bit you will see
this ""people also ask"" area - giving you even more long-tail keyword search
ideas:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

search-ideas-using-googles-people-also-
ask-1024x916-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>If you start clicking on them, you get an essentially infinite number of new
ideas:</p>

<h3>Wonder Search</h3>
<p>Wonder Search is a free keyword tool that collects keyword terms that are
semantically related to your seed keyword.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/wonder-search-ch.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/wonder-search-
ch-1024x653-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Basically, you enter a keyword and get a big list of those ""People also ask""
type keywords.</p>
<p>However, at the time of writing this, it seems they are having problems so I
can't show you an example.</p>
<h1>WonderSearchFail</h1>
<h3>Google Search Console</h3>
<p>Google Search Console ""Performance report"" shows you keywords that your
website is showing up for somewhere on Google's index.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/using-google-
search-concsole-to-find-long-tail-keywords.gif"" /></p>
<h3>Google Trends</h3>
<p>Google Trends is a tool that allows you to see interest related to a search
term over time, so you know if the topic you are researching is growing or
shrinking in consumer interest.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

<p>It looks like the interest for ""long tail keywords"" is on the rise .. kinda.</p>

<h3>Forums</h3>
<p>Forums are goldmines for getting a pulse on your audience.</p>
<p>It's a place dedicated for questions and answers - and the people posting in
them are obviously die hard enough to signup and have conversations.</p>
<p>We highly recommend making a list of forums and taking a few hours (or ideally
even days) going through and seeing what kind of pain points your audience has
- these are issues you can create content around and help give people answers.</p>
<p>If they are asking these questions in forums it means one of 3 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>They couldn't find the answers on Google</li>
<li>They don't trust the answers on Google</li>
<li>The answers on Google don't work</li>
</ol>
<p>A perfect opportunity for you to slide in to help people and make some sales:
win-win!</p>
<p><strong>Start by searching for forums:</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

keywords-to-find-fprums-1024x912-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Scroll through the topics and get instant ideas for content (and also people
you can contact to start engaging &amp; potentially drum up some interest in your
products/services)</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/using-long-tail-keywords-to-find-fprums-2.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/using-long-tail-

<h3>Online Q&amp;A Sites</h3>
<p>Online Q&amp;A sites are like forums, but a little more accessible.</p>
<p>They are places where people ask questions - and another amazing place for you
to find some long tail keyword &amp; content ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some of the popular Q &amp;A sites you can search through:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Quora</li>
<li>Yahoo Answers</li>
<li>Woofresh</li>
<li>Reddit</li>
<li>Does anybody else…?</li>
<li>Explain me Like I'm Five</li>
<li>Ask Science</li>
<li>Ask Historians</li>
<li>Ask Culinary</li>
<li>Answers</li>
<li>Tip of my tongue</li>
<li>AskOpinion</li>
<li>Kuora</li>
<li>Yahoo Answers</li>
<li>Answers</li>
<li>Questions2Answer</li>
</ul>
<p>The premise is the same: Search your keyword &gt; Look at what people are asking
(use these as keyword ideas).</p>
<p><strong>Pro-tip</strong> : After you begin creating content you can go back to these sites
&amp; have conversations with people and link them to the resource you made on the
topic.</p>
<h3>Social Groups</h3>
<p>Use social groups like you use Forums and Q&amp;A sites.</p>
<ol>
<li>Join Groups &gt; See what people are asking questions about &gt; Get ideas for keywords &amp; content pieces</li>
<li>Write your content</li>
<li>Go back to the groups &amp; engage in conversations with people and link to your helpful resources</li>
</ol>
<h3>Soovle</h3>
<p>Soovle is a website that gives you search suggestions &amp; auto0completions from
the top providers on the internet.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/using-soovle-for-
longtail-keyword-research-1024x366-1.png"" /></p>
<p>As soon as I run my search (sticking with the example of ""vitamins"") you start
seing the autocomplete information from all the different search engines
pictured above:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

list of tools, or are just a plain old keyword masochist - check out or
article dedicated to showing you all the keyword research tools that are on
the market.</p>
<h2>How to Use Long Tail Keywords</h2>
<p><strong>1. Create a piece of content optimized around the longtail keyword</strong></p>
<p>We deployed this strategy for one of our clients and you can see that the long
tail keyword pieces of content we created are actually their Top Pages!</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/how-to-use-long-tail-keywords-1.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-to-use-long-
tail-keywords-1-1024x638-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p><strong>2. Add longtail keywords into your articles (if they are semantic
keywords, LSI keywords, or supporting keywords)</strong></p>
<p>Adding longtail keywords (semantic, LSI &amp; supporting) helps build the breadth
&amp; comprehensiveness of your article.</p>
<p>They help make your content a super valuable resource that will answer
questions thoroughly but also help with SEO because they add additional
keywords which allow your article to rank for so many more phrases that can
bring you search volume.</p>
<p>Here is an example from one of our clients where we created a big article
around the seed keyword ""essential oils guide"" but ended up indexing for a ton
of additional longer tail keywords.</p>
<p>You can see from the screenshot that by deploying this correctly, you can turn
an article that was built around one seed term (essential oils guide) into an
article that ranks for 160+ keywords!</p>

tail-keywords-2-1024x235-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>3. Use long-tail keywords as your ""cluster content"" pieces that bolster &amp;
link back to your pillar pieces of content</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Longtail keywords can power your content strategy to increase website traffic &amp; sales. </li>
<li>Longtail keywords are easier to rank for and carry more purchase intent.</li>

As Google's algorithm ""evolves"", and gets more intelligent, it is better able
to determine what your webpage is about - and one of these improvements is
through LSI.

LSI, an acronym for Latent Semantic Indexing, is an  **indexing**  and
retrieval method that uses a mathematical technique called singular value
decomposition (SVD) to identify patterns in the relationships between the
terms and concepts contained in an unstructured collection of text.
([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis))

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-7-1.gif)

Great... Another definition that doesn't make any sense unless I have 4 PhDs.

So, let me put it another way that's easier to grasp:

 **Latent semantic indexing** is an information retrieval concept used by
search engines to uncover & understand how content & terms content work
together to create meaning - even if they do not share synonyms or keywords.

Still a bit confusing, but probably starting to make a little more sense, yes?

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-6-2.gif)

Keep reading and you will be the LSI master by the end of this.

## What Are LSI Keywords?

So, we know that search engines are smart enough to identify & understand the
context of your content, and the synonyms that are related to your keywords.

But LSI is not this simple - a lot of people think LSI keywords are just
simply synonyms, but that is not correct (otherwise we would just call them
synonym keywords).

The simplest definition for **LSI keywords I can give is that they are just
words frequently found together because they have a similar context**.

Almost like...complementary words.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/crop-0-0-633-174-0-lsi-keywords-are-
complementary.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/lsi-keywords-are-complementary.png)

It is a way for search engines to fully understand what a page is about when
there might otherwise be confusing.

Remember back in the day when you would Google something like ""Apple"" (hoping
to find some nutrition information about your favorite fruit) only to be given
a page of results about this new thing called an iPod?

Well, Latent Semantic Indexing helps solve that problem.

 **Here is a great example:**

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/lsi-keywords-
example.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/lsi-
keywords-example.png)

## How Does Google Use Latent Semantic Indexing?

In Google's earlier iterations (the ""easy to SEO"" Google) the algorithm would
determine what a page was about solely by reading keywords.

You could put your keyword on the page 1000 times and almost instantly rank
for it (called keyword stuffing - don't do this now, it will get your website
penalized and it reads like total dog shᴉt)

This might have worked back in 2011, but since the release of 2 major
algorithm updates: Hummingbird & RankBrain, Google has become significantly
better at understanding  _context & meaning_ of a webpage with regards to a
user's search query, by understanding the **_relationship_** of related words
& phrases found in the content.

Here is an example of keywords stuffing.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/example-of-
keyword-stuffing.gif)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/example-of-keyword-stuffing.gif)

A page about ""chiropractic treatment"" that uses the word chiropractic 57
times, and treatment 39 times (in a fairly short article I might add).

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/just-repeating-
keywords-used-to-be-effective-1024x570-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/just-repeating-keywords-used-to-be-effective.png)

If Google saw a keyword used over and over again it thought ""well this page is
clearly super relevant to this term it talks about is _soooo much_ "".

But, we all know this isn't how people talk. And Google knows that. So with
the introduction of Latent Semantic Indexing, the algorithm can now use OTHER
words (those complementary words we mentioned earlier) to understand what a
page is about.

Now, with LSI technology, Google can read a page's content and understand the
overall topic/context.

topic.png)

## Why Are LSI Keywords Important for SEO?

LSI Keywords allow Google to determine the context & topic of your page.

And when Google can confidently understand what your page is about it will
trust you more -thus giving you credit for being relevant for that topic and
reward you with an SEO boost.

Certain groupings of words are seen together in predictable patterns.

Google sees these patterns, and begins to understand more about the intent &
meaning behind a user's search query - instead of just relying on matching up
keywords to determine relevance, it can match up intent with meaning.

This allows Google to improve the match between the search query (what someone
searches for) and the result (the resource Google provides to answer that
query).

Starting to sound like robots can think like humans.

### The Benefits of Using LSI Keywords for SEO

  * Better rankings.
  * More natural than keyword stuffing, which helps you avoid algorithmic penalties
  * Help you reduce page bounce rates by preventing your website from ranking for the wrong terms.
  * Help you retain search traffic/visitors to your site because your content is more relevant, natural & meaningful to the reader.

## How to Find LSI Keywords

There are some great methods & keyword tools that can help you find LSI
Keywords.

 **Our Top Recommendations For Finding LSI keywords:**

  1. Google
  2. Competitors
  3. LSI Graph
  4. Twin Word
  5. Semantic Link

### Google

Using Google to find LSI keywords is a great way to get started.

For example, let's say you are writing about asthma. Some of the things you
might want to cover are symptoms, treatments, diagnosis, and other common
words usually mentioned when discussing the condition.

How do you know to use all these? Well, just Google your and look through the

Remember, we are trying to find things that people _generally associate with_
and _search for information about_ when understanding how we can
comprehensively cover a topic (and get our LSI keywords into our content).

### Competitors

Using competitors to find LSI keywords is an amazing ""SEO hack"".

You are basically relying on the fact that Google _already trusts_ the people
on Page 1 - so why not reverse engineer their success?

It works like magic in SEO (and most things digital marketing as well).

 **1\. Enter your**[ **seed keyword**](https://devinschumacher.com/seed-
keywords/) **into Ahrefs keywords explorer** :

content/uploads/2019/10/using-competitors-to-find-LSI-keywords-1.png)

 **2\. Scroll down to see the ""SERP Overview"" (aka who is ranking at the top)
& click on the keywords (its a number) to see all the keywords that their
article is showing up for**:

content/uploads/2019/10/using-competitors-to-find-LSI-keywords-2.png)

 **3\. Scroll through their keywords to get ideas of more keywords that you
should include in your article (or larger content strategy):**

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/using-competitors-

content/uploads/2019/10/using-competitors-to-find-LSI-keywords-3.png)

You can see from the screenshot above that this ONE article that is ranking
for ""asthma"" is also ranking for 1,595 other related keywords in the USA
alone!

That is the power of the LSI.

### LSI Graph

[Twin Word](https://www.twinword.com/) is a super cool tool that gives you a
little ""web"" of LSI keywords you can include in your research:

 **1\. Search your keyword:**

### Semantic Link

[Semantic Link](http://semantic-link.com/) is another great tool for finding
LSIs.

## How to Use LSI Keywords

You use LSI keywords just like you do any kind of [on-page SEO
optimization](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/) \- naturally
throughout important places in the content:

### 1\. Choose The Right Keywords

Choose the right keywords is really the foundation of doing this right.

Start with the keyword tools, but most importantly use your brain.

These tools are not always correct, and sometimes pull up weird keywords that
aren't actually something you want to include, just use common sense to weed
out the weird ones.

### 2\. Follow Proper On-Page SEO Optimization

  * URL
  * Page Title
  * H1, H2s, H3s, etc.
  * Within content
  * Image Alt Text
  * Inner links

### 3\. Keep Your Writing Natural

The easiest way to properly use LSI keywords is just to be natural.

Do your research, understand your topic, outline your article - and start
writing.

Don't worry too much about placing these all the LSIs in strategic places so
much - just write. In the end you can go back through and see if there are
opportunities to naturally slide some more terms into the important places in
that you know about from learning about on page seo.

## Final Thoughts

  * LSI Keywords are words & phrases that are commonly associated/used with your primary keyword when discussing it comprehensively.
  * LSI Keywords help search engines understand the true _meaning_ of a page by understanding the relationship between two or more words.

<p>As Google's algorithm ""evolves"", and gets more intelligent, it is better able
to determine what your webpage is about - and one of these improvements is
through LSI.</p>
<p>LSI, an acronym for Latent Semantic Indexing, is an  <strong>indexing</strong>  and
retrieval method that uses a mathematical technique called singular value
decomposition (SVD) to identify patterns in the relationships between the
terms and concepts contained in an unstructured collection of text.
(<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis"">source</a>)</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-7-1.gif"" /></p>
<p>Great... Another definition that doesn't make any sense unless I have 4 PhDs.</p>
<p>So, let me put it another way that's easier to grasp:</p>
<p><strong>Latent semantic indexing</strong> is an information retrieval concept used by
search engines to uncover &amp; understand how content &amp; terms content work
together to create meaning - even if they do not share synonyms or keywords.</p>
<p>Still a bit confusing, but probably starting to make a little more sense, yes?</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-6-2.gif"" /></p>
<p>Keep reading and you will be the LSI master by the end of this.</p>
<h2>What Are LSI Keywords?</h2>
<p>So, we know that search engines are smart enough to identify &amp; understand the
context of your content, and the synonyms that are related to your keywords.</p>
<p>But LSI is not this simple - a lot of people think LSI keywords are just
simply synonyms, but that is not correct (otherwise we would just call them
synonym keywords).</p>
<p>The simplest definition for <strong>LSI keywords I can give is that they are just
words frequently found together because they have a similar context</strong>.</p>
<p>Almost like...complementary words.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/lsi-keywords-are-complementary.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/crop-0-0-633-174-0-lsi-keywords-are-
complementary.png"" /></a></p>
<p>It is a way for search engines to fully understand what a page is about when
there might otherwise be confusing.</p>
<p>Remember back in the day when you would Google something like ""Apple"" (hoping
to find some nutrition information about your favorite fruit) only to be given
a page of results about this new thing called an iPod?</p>
<p>Well, Latent Semantic Indexing helps solve that problem.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a great example:</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/lsi-
keywords-example.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/lsi-keywords-
example.png"" /></a></p>
<h2>How Does Google Use Latent Semantic Indexing?</h2>
<p>In Google's earlier iterations (the ""easy to SEO"" Google) the algorithm would
determine what a page was about solely by reading keywords.</p>
<p>You could put your keyword on the page 1000 times and almost instantly rank
for it (called keyword stuffing - don't do this now, it will get your website
penalized and it reads like total dog shᴉt)</p>
<p>This might have worked back in 2011, but since the release of 2 major
algorithm updates: Hummingbird &amp; RankBrain, Google has become significantly
better at understanding  <em>context &amp; meaning</em> of a webpage with regards to a
user's search query, by understanding the <strong><em>relationship</em></strong> of related words
&amp; phrases found in the content.</p>
<p>Here is an example of keywords stuffing.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/example-of-keyword-stuffing.gif""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/example-of-
keyword-stuffing.gif"" /></a></p>
<p>A page about ""chiropractic treatment"" that uses the word chiropractic 57
times, and treatment 39 times (in a fairly short article I might add).</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/just-repeating-keywords-used-to-be-effective.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/just-repeating-
keywords-used-to-be-effective-1024x570-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>If Google saw a keyword used over and over again it thought ""well this page is
clearly super relevant to this term it talks about is <em>soooo much</em> "".</p>
<p>But, we all know this isn't how people talk. And Google knows that. So with
the introduction of Latent Semantic Indexing, the algorithm can now use OTHER
words (those complementary words we mentioned earlier) to understand what a
page is about.</p>
<p>Now, with LSI technology, Google can read a page's content and understand the
overall topic/context.</p>

<h2>Why Are LSI Keywords Important for SEO?</h2>
<p>LSI Keywords allow Google to determine the context &amp; topic of your page.</p>
<p>And when Google can confidently understand what your page is about it will
trust you more -thus giving you credit for being relevant for that topic and
reward you with an SEO boost.</p>
<p>Certain groupings of words are seen together in predictable patterns.</p>
<p>Google sees these patterns, and begins to understand more about the intent &amp;
meaning behind a user's search query - instead of just relying on matching up
keywords to determine relevance, it can match up intent with meaning.</p>
<p>This allows Google to improve the match between the search query (what someone
searches for) and the result (the resource Google provides to answer that
query).</p>
<p>Starting to sound like robots can think like humans.</p>

<h3>The Benefits of Using LSI Keywords for SEO</h3>
<ul>
<li>Better rankings.</li>
<li>More natural than keyword stuffing, which helps you avoid algorithmic penalties</li>
<li>Help you reduce page bounce rates by preventing your website from ranking for the wrong terms.</li>
<li>Help you retain search traffic/visitors to your site because your content is more relevant, natural &amp; meaningful to the reader.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Find LSI Keywords</h2>
<p>There are some great methods &amp; keyword tools that can help you find LSI
Keywords.</p>
<p><strong>Our Top Recommendations For Finding LSI keywords:</strong></p>

operation.

Seed keywords (aka ""primary"" or ""head"" ""main"" keywords) refer to the keyword
that your article is baseline keyword that your article (or articles if you
are making a list of seed keywords) is about.

Think of these like your foundation, or ground zero, for building out all the
topics & articles you will write about on your website.

When we create content for our websites (with SEO in mind) we usually start by
finding seed keywords and then expanding on those keywords (similar to making
an outline) by finding supporting keywords - before we start writing an
article.

Seed keywords are usually the primary topic, or subtopic, that many other
articles can be written about.

Let's say your site is about health, and one thing you sell is vitamins. You
can start with that and easily expand just the word ""vitamins"" into TONS of
other topics - here is a quick example of how fast that evolution can happen
just using the Google search bar:

1\. Start with ""Vitamins""

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/seed-kw-
example-1.png)

2\. Expand on that

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/seed-kw-
example-2.png)

3\. Add a modifier word ""for""

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/seed-kw-
example-3.png)

4\. Pick a direction, in this case, ""women""

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/seed-kw-
example-4.png)

You can see we now already have a TON of topics, and we only went down ONE
rabbit hole.

Finding seed keywords & creating a list is not an exact science, but there is
a loose process we follow each time to give us awesome results.

Creating your seed keyword list before you starting writing will significantly
improve the organization, and SEO success, of your website. It will also make
your life much easier when you actually sit down to start writing.

Depending on how familiar you are with the industry of the website you are
planning (if it's your website you will be very familiar, but if you are doing
this for a client you might need a little research first) will dictate where
you start.

To help you master this skill we will use real-life examples from different
industries throughout the article so you can see how to successfully put this
into practice and apply it to your industry.

## How To Find Seed Keywords

 **Some of the primary ways we start building a seed keyword list are:**

  * Topics
  * Product or Service Terms
  * Google Related Searches
  * Competitor Keywords

### Topics

If you know your industry then start by using your brain - think & write down
some topics.

For example, our industry is Digital Marketing, and within digital marketing,
there are many areas of expertise:

  * Advertising
  * Analytics
  * Conversion Rate Optimization
  * Email Marketing
  * SEO
  * Social Media Marketing
  * Website Design & Development

So, just by laying out those _topics_ we (potentially) have a list of seed
keyword terms, or at the very least a list of topics that we can further break
down into seed keyword terms (depending on the size of the topics).

For us, each of the topics in the area of digital marketing is extremely
large, so we would want to tackle these one at a time.

You can see a real-life example of this when you go to SERP University and
look at how we broke down each of these topics, but I'll keep going with this
example so you can get some more practice.

Let's take SEO for this example.

Because we know our industry I can break down the _topic_ of SEO into further
topics that we can potentially use as seed keywords.

 **Within SEO we have:**

  * Local SEO
  * Ecommerce SEO
  * On-page SEO
  * Off-page SEO (link building)
  * Technical SEO
  * White hat SEO
  * Black hat SEO

 **An example of seed keyword/topic planning using a mind map:**

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-04-at-10.30.53-am-1024x535-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-04-at-10.30.53-AM.png)

In fact, we actually recommend you use a mind map, or a spreadsheet, or
Dynalist.

 **An example of seed keyword/topic planning using Dynalist:**

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/crop-19-92-565-2773-0-an-example-of-building-a-
keyword-list-by-breaking-out-topics.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/an-example-of-building-a-keyword-list-by-breaking-out-
topics.png)

 **An example of seed keyword/topic planning using a spreadsheet:**

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-04-at-10.38.40-am.png)

We normally will use a spreadsheet, or Dynalist - depending on how many layers
the topic can break broken down to, how many keywords there are, etc.

 **Summary** : If you know your industry, just start writing down the main
topical areas of interest and then breaking them into subtopics. We will
verify the search volume, difficulty, and sub-topics we can create around
these primary topics later.

### Product or Service Terms

Another great way to start understanding & creating your seed keywords list is
just by making a list of your products/services.

This time we will use a Dentist as an example.

I would start by listing the main products/services the Dentist provides (and
also what they help).

Remember, you want to try and use colloquial terms - things normal people
would search for. For example, if you sell something like Opalescence PF 35%
Whitening Gel, you would probably want to just list that as ""teeth whitening"".

We also recommend listing the names of your specialties, because people search
those terms too, like: orthodontist, periodontist, etc.

  * Teeth whitening
  * Teeth cleaning
  * Dentures
  * Braces
  * Orthodontist
  * Dentistry for kids
  * Cavities
  * Fillings
  * Invisalign
  * Veneers
  * Root canals
  * Implants
  * Crowns
  * Bridges
  * Wisdom Teeth
  * Gingivitis
  * Bad Breath
  * etc.

This is going to act as a great starting point for creating your seed keyword
list.

We will verify the search volume, difficulty, and sub-topics we can create
around these primary topics later.

### Current Ranking Keywords

If you are a little less familiar with the industry and need to get some
ideas, one great way to find seed keywords is to look at what keywords the
website is already ranking for.

Use a tool like Ahrefs to see what keywords the site is already showing up for
and that will begin to guide your seed keyword creation.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/oct-04-2019-10-47-39.gif)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/oct-04-2019-10-47-39.gif)

### Competitor Keywords

If your website is new, or just doesn't have any current rankings, you can
look at your competitors' rankings.

**Use Ahrefs to look at the competitor's keywords:**

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/seed-
keywords-1-1024x638-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/seed-
keywords-1.png)[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/seed-
keywords-2-1024x957-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/seed-keywords-2.png)

Once you run out of ideas from your competitor, you can actually use Ahrefs to
find MORE competitors, and then look at their keywords.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/seed-
keywords-3-1024x856-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/seed-keywords-3.png)

### Create a Seed Keywords List (Thinking Outside The Box Methods)

If those primary ways don't work for you, here are some other great ways to
find some seed keywords to start your keyword research journey - remember, you
are trying to get inside the head of your industry and competitors, but most
importantly of your audience & potential customers.

  *  **Blog Comments** : Read the questions & comments on your industry-relevant blog posts.
  *  **Social Media** : Read the posts & comments in industry-relevant social media groups
  *  **Forums** : Read what people are talking about / asking for in industry-relevant forums.
  *  **Online communities** : Read the questions & comments on online communities like Quora, Yahoo Answers, Reddit, etc. (e.g. Reddit and Quora).
  *  **Help & Support**: Read through all your past help requests & support tickets.

<p>In fact, we actually recommend you use a mind map, or a spreadsheet, or
Dynalist.</p>

<p>We normally will use a spreadsheet, or Dynalist - depending on how many layers
the topic can break broken down to, how many keywords there are, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong> : If you know your industry, just start writing down the main
topical areas of interest and then breaking them into subtopics. We will
verify the search volume, difficulty, and sub-topics we can create around
these primary topics later.</p>
<h3>Product or Service Terms</h3>
<p>Another great way to start understanding &amp; creating your seed keywords list is
just by making a list of your products/services.</p>
<p>This time we will use a Dentist as an example.</p>
<p>I would start by listing the main products/services the Dentist provides (and
also what they help).</p>
<p>Remember, you want to try and use colloquial terms - things normal people
would search for. For example, if you sell something like Opalescence PF 35%
Whitening Gel, you would probably want to just list that as ""teeth whitening"".</p>
<p>We also recommend listing the names of your specialties, because people search
those terms too, like: orthodontist, periodontist, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teeth whitening</li>
<li>Teeth cleaning</li>
<li>Dentures</li>
<li>Braces</li>
<li>Orthodontist</li>
<li>Dentistry for kids</li>
<li>Cavities</li>
<li>Fillings</li>
<li>Invisalign</li>
<li>Veneers</li>
<li>Root canals</li>
<li>Implants</li>
<li>Crowns</li>
<li>Bridges</li>
<li>Wisdom Teeth</li>
<li>Gingivitis</li>
<li>Bad Breath</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is going to act as a great starting point for creating your seed keyword
list.</p>
<p>We will verify the search volume, difficulty, and sub-topics we can create
around these primary topics later.</p>
<h3>Current Ranking Keywords</h3>
<p>If you are a little less familiar with the industry and need to get some
ideas, one great way to find seed keywords is to look at what keywords the
website is already ranking for.</p>
<p>Use a tool like Ahrefs to see what keywords the site is already showing up for
and that will begin to guide your seed keyword creation.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/oct-04-2019-10-47-39.gif""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/oct-04-2019-10-47-39.gif"" /></a></p>
<h3>Competitor Keywords</h3>
<p>If your website is new, or just doesn't have any current rankings, you can
look at your competitors' rankings.</p>
<p><strong>Use Ahrefs to look at the competitor's keywords:</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/seed-
keywords-1.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/seed-
keywords-1-1024x638-1.png"" /></a><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

content/uploads/2022/08/seed-
keywords-2-1024x957-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Once you run out of ideas from your competitor, you can actually use Ahrefs to
find MORE competitors, and then look at their keywords.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/seed-keywords-3.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/seed-
keywords-3-1024x856-1.png"" /></a></p>
<h3>Create a Seed Keywords List (Thinking Outside The Box Methods)</h3>
<p>If those primary ways don't work for you, here are some other great ways to
find some seed keywords to start your keyword research journey - remember, you
are trying to get inside the head of your industry and competitors, but most
importantly of your audience &amp; potential customers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog Comments</strong> : Read the questions &amp; comments on your industry-relevant blog posts.</li>
<li><strong>Social Media</strong> : Read the posts &amp; comments in industry-relevant social media groups</li>
<li><strong>Forums</strong> : Read what people are talking about / asking for in industry-relevant forums.</li>
<li><strong>Online communities</strong> : Read the questions &amp; comments on online communities like Quora, Yahoo Answers, Reddit, etc. (e.g. Reddit and Quora).</li>
<li><strong>Help &amp; Support</strong>: Read through all your past help requests &amp; support tickets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Building a list of seed keywords sets the foundation for your content creation
initiative &amp; will significantly help the success of your SEO campaign.</p>
<p>Creating your list of seed keywords is just the beginning of the keyword
research &amp; planning process, so be sure to keep reading.</p>

can change your business forever.

## What Are SEO Keywords?

SEO keywords (aka ""keyword"", ""key-phrase"", ""search term"") is used to refer to
any 'word', 'phrase' or even sometimes a full 'sentence' that people regularly
type in to search engines to get answers to their questions.

Although the terms are used interchangeable, we differentiate ""SEO Keywords""
from just ""Keywords"" because the ""Keywords"" that you use for Pay-per-click
(PPC) advertising have different properties/concepts associated with them.

Keywords are words & phrases that we intentionally optimize our content (blog
posts, website pages, videos, etc.) around because we know that it is a word
that is commonly searched.

How do we know this? Because we can get the information from Keyword tools, or
even Google, giving us an average monthly ""search volume"".

This allows us to pick search terms that are relevant to our business and we
know people are already actively using.

We can find out the keywords people use, and the amount of times they are
searched each month on average (search volume) through the keyword research
process.

## Why Are Keywords Important?

Keywords are important because they guide our SEO efforts, and allow us to
strategically build our web pages & website content while focusing on the most
important (and ROI driving) areas first.

If we know, for example, that we want to sell more [digital marketing services
in Los Angeles,
California](https://devinschumacher.com/services/marketing/los-angeles/) we
can actually find out the exact ""keywords"" people are typing in to Google to
look for potential providers.

Then, we can create a page on our website on that topic & optimize our content
around those keywords - giving ourselves the best chance to rank well for it.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/keywords-and-
search-volumes-for-digital-marketing-company-in-los-
angeles.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/keywords-
and-search-volumes-for-digital-marketing-company-in-los-angeles.png)

Once you figure out the ""keywords"" that you want to target to bring ""targeted
traffic"" to your website you can start planning the rest of your SEO campaign,
including:

  * Mapping  your site architecture
  * Planning your services, products & category pages
  * Writing blog content
  * Optimizing sales pages & landing pages

We do this by mapping a group of similar/semantic keywords (like you can see
above in the screenshot) to one page on your website & strategically using the
keyword (naturally) throughout the content:

## How To Choose The Best Keywords For SEO

Choosing keywords for SEO is half science, half art form.

We will cover this extensively in our keyword research guide & content
strategy lessons, but the general process goes like this:

  * Use a keyword tool to create a list of all the keywords that are important to your business
  * Organize those keywords into groups
  * Find & add the keyword search volumes & competitiveness (so you can start by going after the easy ones first)
  * Look at the SERPs for keywords to understand potential CTR & traffic
  * Create a website sitemap that covers all the relevant commercial intent keywords
  * Create a content strategy that covers all the relevant informational intent keywords
  * Start writing

To best understand how to choose keywords for SEO, you will first want to
familiarize yourself with some foundational keyword concepts.

## Keyword Concepts & Properties

  * Keyword Difficulty
  * Search Volume
  * Keyword Density
  * Keyword Research
  * User Intent

### Keyword Difficulty

Keyword difficulty (KD) refers to how hard it will be for you to rank well for
a certain keyword.

The exact definition from Ahrefs on KD is:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/definition-of-
keyword-difficulty.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/definition-of-keyword-difficulty.png)

Before you start spending time, money, resources on creating content &
acquiring links (can be very expensive) you want to make sure that you even
have a chance to rank for a keyword.

If you can't get to Page 1 you aren't going to get much traffic (if any) from
your efforts, so understand how difficult a keyword is going to be to rank for
is a very important consideration.

### Search Volume

Keyword ""search volume"" tells us how many times that exact keyword is getting
searched in Google every month (on average).

If you had to choose between ranking for a keyword that actually gets searched
10,000 times per month, or one that only gets searched 10 times per month -
what would you choose?

Of course you would choose the one with more search volume (assuming they are
both relevant to your business, and have similar intent, etc.)

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/saerch-volume-
definition.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/saerch-volume-definition.png)

### Keyword Density

Keyword density refers to how many times a keyword appears in your content.

An old [black hat seo](https://devinschumacher.com/black-hat-seo/) trick was
to add your target keyword into a page as many times as possible (called
""keyword stuffing"") so when Google came to the page and read the text it would
see the keyword in there so many times that the algorithm thought ""well, it
says this keyword 1000 times, it MUST be super relevant to this, let's rank
this highly).

This no longer works, and once Google caught on they updated their algorithm
to actually demote or penalize you for doing this.

So, keyword density is a way for us to analyze a page and make sure we are not
""over optimizing"" (aka keyword stuffing) our content.

### Keyword Research

Keyword research is a huge topic, and we cover it in-depth in other articles,
but the general idea behind this concept is that before you start writing
content for your website you want to do your research first.

Kind of like anything else in life, first do the research then do the work.

Keyword research is the process of finding, categorizing, organizing and
planning all the keywords you want to rank for and then systematically
creating that content with a strategy in mind - usually one where you start
with the easiest keywords (that have decent search volume) first, and work
your way up to the harder ones.

Check out our full guide to keyword research for more info.

### User Intent

User intent (aka ""keyword intent"", ""buyer intent"", ""search intent"", etc.) is a
very important concept of understanding keywords.

This is the ability to understand what the user actually wants when searching
for something, so that you (as the product/service provider) can be sure to
provide content that satisfies the searchers need.

Understanding the intent behind keywords allows you to effectively prioritize
your content creation efforts around the terms that are _most likely to bring
you immediate sales._

 **Here are some examples of different keyword intent to make this clear** :

  *  **Commercial / Buyer intent** : Person searches ""pizza delivery near me"". The intent is probably to buy a pizza, right now. This person is likely to spend money with your pizza place. This would be a great place to put resources to try and rank for.
  *  **Informational (with some monetary) intent** : Person searches ""pizza making recipes"". The intent is probably not to buy a pizza, but to make one. Maybe now, maybe later. This person is not likely to spend money with your pizza place right now, but you know they are interested in pizza and maybe could be a good candidate to show some Ads or offers to.
  *  **Informational (Curiosity) intent** : What was the biggest pizza ever made? This person is probably not going to spend money with you anytime soon, or ever, and you probably shouldn't spend your resources on ranking for this keyword.

## Keywords Types

  * Commercial Intent Keywords
  * Informational Intent Keywords
  * Local Intent Keywords
  * Seed Keywords
  * Semantic Keywords
  * Secondary Keywords
  * LSI Keywords
  * Short-tail Keywords
  * Medium-tail Keywords
  * Long-tail Keywords
  * Branded Keywords
  * Exact Match Keywords
  * Keyword Variations
  * Meta Keywords

### Commercial Intent Keywords

Commercial intent keywords are the keywords or phrases that carry alot of
purchase intent.

Meaning, that if someone is searching with this type of keyword they are
""ready to buy"", or at least more likely to buy than someone searching with a
non commercial intent keyword.

Example, if someone is searching for ""emergency dentist near me"" they probably
have a serious problem and are **very** ready to buy.

Maybe they just did this and need some serious teeth fixing:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/download-4-3.gif)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/download-4-3.gif)

Commercial intent keywords usually have ""modifiers"" (like a prefix, or a
suffix) that people commonly use when they are close to buying, like:

  * [keyword] near me
  * [keyword] discount
  * [keyword] coupon
  * best [keyword] for [XYZ]
  * top rated [keyword]
  * cheap [keyword]
  * etc.

### Informational Intent Keywords

Informational intent keywords are almost the opposite of commercial intent -
instead of someone searching because they are ready to buy, they are searching
because they are not quite yet ready to buy.

Maybe they know their problem but want more information before deciding if
they are going to spend money - for example ""cost to fix tooth"" or ""home
remedy for headaches"".

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/informational-
intent-keywords.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/informational-intent-keywords.png)

This is an informational keyword that still holds some buyer intent - if the
person likes the content they read they may end up purchasing (which is
basically your marketing funnel / content marketing at work!)

Maybe they want to buy, maybe they don't.

Maybe they want to DIY (do-it-yourself), but maybe they can be convinced to
use a product.

Either way it is still a valuable opportunity for your brand to create content
around what they are searching for and put content in front of a
_prospective/potential customer_.

### Local Intent Keywords

Local intent keywords are keywords that people are using when searching for
businesses near them.

They are keywords that ""trigger"" a ""Local SERP"", that is a Search Engine
Results Page with Maps.

They can have ""geo-modifiers"" on them, like the name of a city:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/local_seo_intent_based_keywords.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/local_seo_intent_based_keywords.png)

or just ""near me"":

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/local-intent-
keyword-geo-modifier-near-me.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/local-intent-keyword-geo-modifier-near-me.png)

But, they don't HAVE to.

Google pretty much always knows where you are (because of GPS and IP addresses
when connected via Wifi) so even if you type a search that Google _normally
associates someone needing a local provider with_ you can still end up with a
Local SERP.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/no_local_modifier__still_get_maps.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/no_local_modifier__still_get_maps.png)

### Seed Keywords

Seed keywords (aka ""primary"", ""main"" or ""parent"" keywords) refer to the
keyword that is the most relevant to the page you are looking to create, and
typically has the highest search volume.

Usually, they are also the shortest version of the keywords (see below for
short tail keywords)

Seed keywords are what you start with when you plan a new page or piece of
content for your website, and then usually add semantic and secondary keywords
to the plan so you can build 1 piece of content that covers all the similar
keywords.

For example, when writing this article we identified our seed keyword to be
""seo keywords""

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/primary-seed-
keyword-1024x257-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/primary-seed-keyword.png)

  *  **Related Reading** : Check out the full article on [Seed Keywords](https://devinschumacher.com/seed-keywords/).

### Semantic Keywords

Semantic keywords are essentially synonyms of the seed keyword.

They are other variations or ways that people could type something into the
search engine but really are looking for the same thing.

For example, if your seed keyword is ""dentist los angeles"" your semantic
keywords would be variations of this like:

  * dentist in los angeles
  * dentist los angeles, ca
  * los angeles dentist
  * dentist in la, ca
  * dentist in los angeles california
  * etc.

All of these are technically different keywords, but the _intent_ of someone
using each one of these is the same - to find a dentist in Los Angeles,
California.

### Secondary Keywords

Secondary keywords are keywords you can use in your content that help make
your article comprehensive and high quality.

For example, we knew that when writing an article about ""seo keywords"" that
the reader (you) would need to know a bunch of supporting information to
_truly understand_ the concept of seo keywords.

A simple definition would be a good start - but it's not enough to
comprehensively cover the topic.

We knew we would have to talk about other things - this is where secondary
keywords come in.

Essentially they are the ""supporting"" or ""sub"" topics that _should_ be covered
in the content in order to give the reader a high-quality, comprehensive
explanation of the topic.

For us, all of our secondary keywords can be found in our articles as H2, H3,
H4s, etc.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/supporting-
secondary-keywords-1024x243-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/supporting-secondary-keywords.png)

### LSI Keywords

Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) Keywords are keyword terms that are
conceptually related to each other (and to your seed keyword) that search
engines recognize usually are used together in content that is about a certain
topic, and helps them to further understand (and validate) the topic of a
given piece of content / webpage.

  *  **Related Reading** : Check out our full guide on [LSI Keywords](https://devinschumacher.com/lsi-keywords/)

### Short-tail Keywords

Short tail keywords are just the short versions of keywords.

They usually have the most search volume, and they also usually have alot of
keyword variations that have the exact same intent.

For example, if you are writing an article about ""vitamins"", then your primary
keyword might be ""vitamins"".

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/short-tail-
keywords.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/short-
tail-keywords.png)

This is also the shortest possible version of this search query (you can't
search less than one word).

But, other longer keywords called ""medium tail"" or ""long tail"" keywords could
also be good either to:

  1. Include in the article (secondary or semantic keywords)
  2. Create other articles from (content clusters)

### Medium-tail Keywords

 **Sticking with the example of ""vitamins"" Some example of Medium-Tail
keywords could be:**

  * best vitamins
  * best vitamins for men
  * best vitamins for women
  * best vitamins for skin

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/medium-tail-
keywords.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/medium-
tail-keywords.png)

### Long-tail Keywords

Once again staying on the vitamin train, some examples of Long-Tail Keywords
could be:

  * best vitamins for women over 50
  * best vitamins for women's hair growth
  * best vitamins for diabetics type 2

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/long-tail-
keywords.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/long-
tail-keywords.png)

You can see that as keywords get longer, the search intent gets more and more
specific.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/long-tail-
keywords-1-1024x926-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/long-tail-keywords-1.png)source: backlinko.com

Search volume also usually goes down (because the more words you add to a
query the less statistical likelihood that multiple people will type that
exact same string.

The benefit of long-tail keywords though as you can probably see from the
screenshot is that the keyword difficulty goes down as well. And, there are
just way more of them.

  *  **Related Reading** : Check out the full article on [Longtail Keywords](https://devinschumacher.com/long-tail-keywords/).

### Branded Keywords

Branded keywords are keywords that are your Brand name, or a variation of it.

 **Branded keywords can be:**

  * Your brand name
  * Your brand name + product
  * A brand name of a product you sell
  * The name of someone in your company

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/branded-
keywords.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/branded-
keywords.png)

### Exact Match Keywords

Exact match keywords is a term used to refer to a keyword that exactly matches
what you are trying to go for.

This is usually more used when we are talking about link building, and what to
make the ""anchor text"" of links.

We dive into this in more depth in our Link Building areas and the posts on
anchor text.

### Keyword Variations

Keyword variations is just a term to mean anytime there is a variation of the
seed keyword.

For example, if your seed keyword is: ""dentist los angeles"" some variations
could be:

  * los angeles dentist
  * dentist los angeles, ca
  * dentist los angeles, california
  * dentist in los angeles

### Meta Keywords

Meta keywords is an actual HTML thing.

They are are a specific type of html meta tag that appears in a web page's
code, and is used to help tell search engines what the page is about.

They used to be a great place for keyword stuffing, but those days are over.

Meta keywords aren't really used anymore - but it's good to know the name if
you want to be a master of SEO.

There is alot of information to digest when learning about Keywords.

In this post we only covered SEO Keywords.

There is still alot more to be said about keywords when talking about the PPC
side (Google Ads), but for now you should have a great foundation of how they
work.

can change your business forever.</p>
<h2>What Are SEO Keywords?</h2>
<p>SEO keywords (aka ""keyword"", ""key-phrase"", ""search term"") is used to refer to
any 'word', 'phrase' or even sometimes a full 'sentence' that people regularly
type in to search engines to get answers to their questions.</p>
<p>Although the terms are used interchangeable, we differentiate ""SEO Keywords""
from just ""Keywords"" because the ""Keywords"" that you use for Pay-per-click
(PPC) advertising have different properties/concepts associated with them.</p>
<p>Keywords are words &amp; phrases that we intentionally optimize our content (blog
posts, website pages, videos, etc.) around because we know that it is a word
that is commonly searched.</p>
<p>How do we know this? Because we can get the information from Keyword tools, or
even Google, giving us an average monthly ""search volume"".</p>
<p>This allows us to pick search terms that are relevant to our business and we
know people are already actively using.</p>
<p>We can find out the keywords people use, and the amount of times they are
searched each month on average (search volume) through the keyword research
process.</p>
<h2>Why Are Keywords Important?</h2>
<p>Keywords are important because they guide our SEO efforts, and allow us to
strategically build our web pages &amp; website content while focusing on the most
important (and ROI driving) areas first.</p>
<p>If we know, for example, that we want to sell more <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/services/marketing/los-angeles/"">digital marketing services
in Los Angeles,
California</a> we
can actually find out the exact ""keywords"" people are typing in to Google to
look for potential providers.</p>
<p>Then, we can create a page on our website on that topic &amp; optimize our content
around those keywords - giving ourselves the best chance to rank well for it.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/keywords-
and-search-volumes-for-digital-marketing-company-in-los-angeles.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/keywords-and-
search-volumes-for-digital-marketing-company-in-los-
angeles.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Once you figure out the ""keywords"" that you want to target to bring ""targeted
traffic"" to your website you can start planning the rest of your SEO campaign,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mapping  your site architecture</li>
<li>Planning your services, products &amp; category pages</li>
<li>Writing blog content</li>
<li>Optimizing sales pages &amp; landing pages</li>
</ul>
<p>We do this by mapping a group of similar/semantic keywords (like you can see
above in the screenshot) to one page on your website &amp; strategically using the
keyword (naturally) throughout the content:</p>

keyword-in-your-content-1-1024x983-1.png"" /></a>source:

<h2>How To Choose The Best Keywords For SEO</h2>
<p>Choosing keywords for SEO is half science, half art form.</p>
<p>We will cover this extensively in our keyword research guide &amp; content
strategy lessons, but the general process goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a keyword tool to create a list of all the keywords that are important to your business</li>
<li>Organize those keywords into groups</li>
<li>Find &amp; add the keyword search volumes &amp; competitiveness (so you can start by going after the easy ones first)</li>
<li>Look at the SERPs for keywords to understand potential CTR &amp; traffic</li>
<li>Create a website sitemap that covers all the relevant commercial intent keywords</li>
<li>Create a content strategy that covers all the relevant informational intent keywords</li>
<li>Start writing</li>
</ul>
<p>To best understand how to choose keywords for SEO, you will first want to
familiarize yourself with some foundational keyword concepts.</p>
<h2>Keyword Concepts &amp; Properties</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keyword Difficulty</li>
<li>Search Volume</li>
<li>Keyword Density</li>
<li>Keyword Research</li>
<li>User Intent</li>
</ul>
<h3>Keyword Difficulty</h3>
<p>Keyword difficulty (KD) refers to how hard it will be for you to rank well for
a certain keyword.</p>
<p>The exact definition from Ahrefs on KD is:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/definition-of-keyword-difficulty.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/definition-of-
keyword-difficulty.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Before you start spending time, money, resources on creating content &amp;
acquiring links (can be very expensive) you want to make sure that you even
have a chance to rank for a keyword.</p>
<p>If you can't get to Page 1 you aren't going to get much traffic (if any) from
your efforts, so understand how difficult a keyword is going to be to rank for
is a very important consideration.</p>
<h3>Search Volume</h3>
<p>Keyword ""search volume"" tells us how many times that exact keyword is getting
searched in Google every month (on average).</p>
<p>If you had to choose between ranking for a keyword that actually gets searched
10,000 times per month, or one that only gets searched 10 times per month -
what would you choose?</p>
<p>Of course you would choose the one with more search volume (assuming they are
both relevant to your business, and have similar intent, etc.)</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/saerch-volume-definition.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/saerch-volume-
definition.png"" /></a></p>
<h3>Keyword Density</h3>
<p>Keyword density refers to how many times a keyword appears in your content.</p>
<p>An old <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/black-hat-seo/"">black hat seo</a> trick was
to add your target keyword into a page as many times as possible (called
""keyword stuffing"") so when Google came to the page and read the text it would
see the keyword in there so many times that the algorithm thought ""well, it
says this keyword 1000 times, it MUST be super relevant to this, let's rank
this highly).</p>
<p>This no longer works, and once Google caught on they updated their algorithm
to actually demote or penalize you for doing this.</p>
<p>So, keyword density is a way for us to analyze a page and make sure we are not
""over optimizing"" (aka keyword stuffing) our content.</p>
<h3>Keyword Research</h3>
<p>Keyword research is a huge topic, and we cover it in-depth in other articles,
but the general idea behind this concept is that before you start writing
content for your website you want to do your research first.</p>
<p>Kind of like anything else in life, first do the research then do the work.</p>
<p>Keyword research is the process of finding, categorizing, organizing and
planning all the keywords you want to rank for and then systematically
creating that content with a strategy in mind - usually one where you start
with the easiest keywords (that have decent search volume) first, and work
your way up to the harder ones.</p>
<p>Check out our full guide to keyword research for more info.</p>
<h3>User Intent</h3>
<p>User intent (aka ""keyword intent"", ""buyer intent"", ""search intent"", etc.) is a
very important concept of understanding keywords.</p>
<p>This is the ability to understand what the user actually wants when searching
for something, so that you (as the product/service provider) can be sure to
provide content that satisfies the searchers need.</p>
<p>Understanding the intent behind keywords allows you to effectively prioritize
your content creation efforts around the terms that are <em>most likely to bring
you immediate sales.</em></p>
<p><strong>Here are some examples of different keyword intent to make this clear</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commercial / Buyer intent</strong> : Person searches ""pizza delivery near me"". The intent is probably to buy a pizza, right now. This person is likely to spend money with your pizza place. This would be a great place to put resources to try and rank for.</li>
<li><strong>Informational (with some monetary) intent</strong> : Person searches ""pizza making recipes"". The intent is probably not to buy a pizza, but to make one. Maybe now, maybe later. This person is not likely to spend money with your pizza place right now, but you know they are interested in pizza and maybe could be a good candidate to show some Ads or offers to.</li>
<li><strong>Informational (Curiosity) intent</strong> : What was the biggest pizza ever made? This person is probably not going to spend money with you anytime soon, or ever, and you probably shouldn't spend your resources on ranking for this keyword.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Keywords Types</h2>
<ul>
<li>Commercial Intent Keywords</li>
<li>Informational Intent Keywords</li>
<li>Local Intent Keywords</li>
<li>Seed Keywords</li>
<li>Semantic Keywords</li>
<li>Secondary Keywords</li>
<li>LSI Keywords</li>
<li>Short-tail Keywords</li>
<li>Medium-tail Keywords</li>
<li>Long-tail Keywords</li>
<li>Branded Keywords</li>
<li>Exact Match Keywords</li>
<li>Keyword Variations</li>
<li>Meta Keywords</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commercial Intent Keywords</h3>
<p>Commercial intent keywords are the keywords or phrases that carry alot of
purchase intent.</p>
<p>Meaning, that if someone is searching with this type of keyword they are
""ready to buy"", or at least more likely to buy than someone searching with a
non commercial intent keyword.</p>
<p>Example, if someone is searching for ""emergency dentist near me"" they probably
have a serious problem and are <strong>very</strong> ready to buy.</p>
<p>Maybe they just did this and need some serious teeth fixing:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/download-4-3.gif""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/download-4-3.gif"" /></a></p>
<p>Commercial intent keywords usually have ""modifiers"" (like a prefix, or a
suffix) that people commonly use when they are close to buying, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>[keyword] near me</li>
<li>[keyword] discount</li>
<li>[keyword] coupon</li>
<li>best [keyword] for [XYZ]</li>
<li>top rated [keyword]</li>
<li>cheap [keyword]</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Informational Intent Keywords</h3>
<p>Informational intent keywords are almost the opposite of commercial intent -
instead of someone searching because they are ready to buy, they are searching
because they are not quite yet ready to buy.</p>
<p>Maybe they know their problem but want more information before deciding if
they are going to spend money - for example ""cost to fix tooth"" or ""home
remedy for headaches"".</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/informational-intent-keywords.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/informational-
intent-keywords.png"" /></a></p>
<p>This is an informational keyword that still holds some buyer intent - if the
person likes the content they read they may end up purchasing (which is
basically your marketing funnel / content marketing at work!)</p>
<p>Maybe they want to buy, maybe they don't.</p>
<p>Maybe they want to DIY (do-it-yourself), but maybe they can be convinced to
use a product.</p>
<p>Either way it is still a valuable opportunity for your brand to create content
around what they are searching for and put content in front of a
<em>prospective/potential customer</em>.</p>
<h3>Local Intent Keywords</h3>
<p>Local intent keywords are keywords that people are using when searching for
businesses near them.</p>
<p>They are keywords that ""trigger"" a ""Local SERP"", that is a Search Engine
Results Page with Maps.</p>
<p>They can have ""geo-modifiers"" on them, like the name of a city:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/local_seo_intent_based_keywords.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/local_seo_intent_based_keywords.png"" /></a></p>
<p>or just ""near me"":</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/local-intent-keyword-geo-modifier-near-me.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/local-intent-
keyword-geo-modifier-near-me.png"" /></a></p>
<p>But, they don't HAVE to.</p>
<p>Google pretty much always knows where you are (because of GPS and IP addresses
when connected via Wifi) so even if you type a search that Google <em>normally
associates someone needing a local provider with</em> you can still end up with a
Local SERP.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/no_local_modifier__still_get_maps.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/no_local_modifier__still_get_maps.png"" /></a></p>
<h3>Seed Keywords</h3>
<p>Seed keywords (aka ""primary"", ""main"" or ""parent"" keywords) refer to the
keyword that is the most relevant to the page you are looking to create, and
typically has the highest search volume.</p>
<p>Usually, they are also the shortest version of the keywords (see below for
short tail keywords)</p>
<p>Seed keywords are what you start with when you plan a new page or piece of
content for your website, and then usually add semantic and secondary keywords
to the plan so you can build 1 piece of content that covers all the similar
keywords.</p>
<p>For example, when writing this article we identified our seed keyword to be
""seo keywords""</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/primary-seed-keyword.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/primary-seed-
keyword-1024x257-1.png"" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Related Reading</strong> : Check out the full article on <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/seed-keywords/"">Seed Keywords</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Semantic Keywords</h3>
<p>Semantic keywords are essentially synonyms of the seed keyword.</p>
<p>They are other variations or ways that people could type something into the
search engine but really are looking for the same thing.</p>
<p>For example, if your seed keyword is ""dentist los angeles"" your semantic
keywords would be variations of this like:</p>
<ul>
<li>dentist in los angeles</li>
<li>dentist los angeles, ca</li>
<li>los angeles dentist</li>
<li>dentist in la, ca</li>
<li>dentist in los angeles california</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are technically different keywords, but the <em>intent</em> of someone
using each one of these is the same - to find a dentist in Los Angeles,
California.</p>
<h3>Secondary Keywords</h3>
<p>Secondary keywords are keywords you can use in your content that help make
your article comprehensive and high quality.</p>
<p>For example, we knew that when writing an article about ""seo keywords"" that
the reader (you) would need to know a bunch of supporting information to
<em>truly understand</em> the concept of seo keywords.</p>
<p>A simple definition would be a good start - but it's not enough to
comprehensively cover the topic.</p>
<p>We knew we would have to talk about other things - this is where secondary
keywords come in.</p>
<p>Essentially they are the ""supporting"" or ""sub"" topics that <em>should</em> be covered
in the content in order to give the reader a high-quality, comprehensive
explanation of the topic.</p>
<p>For us, all of our secondary keywords can be found in our articles as H2, H3,
H4s, etc.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/supporting-secondary-keywords.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/supporting-
secondary-keywords-1024x243-1.png"" /></a></p>
<h3>LSI Keywords</h3>
<p>Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) Keywords are keyword terms that are
conceptually related to each other (and to your seed keyword) that search
engines recognize usually are used together in content that is about a certain
topic, and helps them to further understand (and validate) the topic of a
given piece of content / webpage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Related Reading</strong> : Check out our full guide on <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/lsi-keywords/"">LSI Keywords</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Short-tail Keywords</h3>
<p>Short tail keywords are just the short versions of keywords.</p>
<p>They usually have the most search volume, and they also usually have alot of
keyword variations that have the exact same intent.</p>
<p>For example, if you are writing an article about ""vitamins"", then your primary
keyword might be ""vitamins"".</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/short-
tail-keywords.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/short-tail-
keywords.png"" /></a></p>
<p>This is also the shortest possible version of this search query (you can't
search less than one word).</p>
<p>But, other longer keywords called ""medium tail"" or ""long tail"" keywords could
also be good either to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Include in the article (secondary or semantic keywords)</li>
<li>Create other articles from (content clusters)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Medium-tail Keywords</h3>
<p><strong>Sticking with the example of ""vitamins"" Some example of Medium-Tail
keywords could be:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>best vitamins</li>
<li>best vitamins for men</li>
<li>best vitamins for women</li>
<li>best vitamins for skin</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/medium-
tail-keywords.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/medium-tail-
keywords.png"" /></a></p>
<h3>Long-tail Keywords</h3>
<p>Once again staying on the vitamin train, some examples of Long-Tail Keywords
could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>best vitamins for women over 50</li>
<li>best vitamins for women's hair growth</li>
<li>best vitamins for diabetics type 2</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/long-
tail-keywords.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/long-tail-
keywords.png"" /></a></p>
<p>You can see that as keywords get longer, the search intent gets more and more
specific.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/long-tail-keywords-1.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/long-tail-
keywords-1-1024x926-1.png"" /></a>source: backlinko.com</p>
<p>Search volume also usually goes down (because the more words you add to a
query the less statistical likelihood that multiple people will type that
exact same string.</p>
<p>The benefit of long-tail keywords though as you can probably see from the
screenshot is that the keyword difficulty goes down as well. And, there are
just way more of them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Related Reading</strong> : Check out the full article on <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/long-tail-keywords/"">Longtail Keywords</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Branded Keywords</h3>
<p>Branded keywords are keywords that are your Brand name, or a variation of it.</p>
<p><strong>Branded keywords can be:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your brand name</li>
<li>Your brand name + product</li>
<li>A brand name of a product you sell</li>
<li>The name of someone in your company</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/branded-
keywords.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/branded-
keywords.png"" /></a></p>
<h3>Exact Match Keywords</h3>
<p>Exact match keywords is a term used to refer to a keyword that exactly matches
what you are trying to go for.</p>
<p>This is usually more used when we are talking about link building, and what to
make the ""anchor text"" of links.</p>
<p>We dive into this in more depth in our Link Building areas and the posts on
anchor text.</p>
<h3>Keyword Variations</h3>
<p>Keyword variations is just a term to mean anytime there is a variation of the
seed keyword.</p>
<p>For example, if your seed keyword is: ""dentist los angeles"" some variations
could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>los angeles dentist</li>
<li>dentist los angeles, ca</li>
<li>dentist los angeles, california</li>
<li>dentist in los angeles</li>
</ul>
<h3>Meta Keywords</h3>
<p>Meta keywords is an actual HTML thing.</p>
<p>They are are a specific type of html meta tag that appears in a web page's
code, and is used to help tell search engines what the page is about.</p>
<p>They used to be a great place for keyword stuffing, but those days are over.</p>
<p>Meta keywords aren't really used anymore - but it's good to know the name if
you want to be a master of SEO.</p>

### Black Hat SEO

Black Hat SEO is a blanket term that basically means ""any SEO that is high
risk"".

It refers to SEO practices that are currently working very well but can be
potentially damaging to your site in the long run.

It's more of a general term that an SEO technique, but it is definitely a
_style_ of doing SEO, so we are including it here.

 **Some examples of Black Hat SEO techniques are:**

  * Spamming
  * Manipulating links
  * Manipulating [anchor texts](https://devinschumacher.com/anchor-text/)
  * Hacking
  * Etc.

[Check out this article for a full list of black hat SEO
techniques.](https://devinschumacher.com/black-hat-seo/)

### White Hat SEO

White Hat SEO is the opposite of Black Hat.

It's a term that is loosely thrown around to refer to SEO practices that are
generally considered safe to do for the long term success of your website.

They may take more work, be more expensive, or just be plain slower - but if
you are looking to grow a sustainable business into the foreseeable future
this is where you normally want to start.

 **Some examples of White Hat SEO techniques are:**

  1. Creating well thought out & fully researched valuable content
  2. Using social media to promote your new content
  3. Always keeping the user in mind when doing SEO, not just Googlebot
  4. Making sure your website loads fast & is mobile responsive
  5. Fixing all technical errors
  6. Etc.

[Check out this article for a full list of white hat seo
techniques.](https://devinschumacher.com/white-hat-seo/)

### Content SEO

[Content SEO (aka Content Marketing](https://devinschumacher.com/what-is-
content-marketing/)) refers to everything that goes into auditing,
researching, planning & creating great content that your readers will love,
and search engines will reward you for.

Content SEO is probably the most fun part of this whole part because it is the
part where you get to take all the knowledge, experience & expertise that you
have and finally communicate to your audience - once and for all - your stance
on things.

Be polarizing, be authentic, be factual - and most of all be entertaining!

Publishing awesome content on your website will start to show search engines
that you are relevant & authoritative in your subject matter - which helps
your SEO progress and leads to better rankings, more traffic, and new sales.

 **Some examples of good Content Marketing techniques are:**

  1. Running an audit of your current site to see what content you have to work with & if there is any room for improvement.
  2. Using keyword analysis tools to see what terms people are searching for in your industry, and building content around those terms.
  3. Building a list of primary keyword terms that are relevant for your business & would make good pieces of content.
  4. Building a list of secondary keyword terms that would warrant their own article, and help to build a ""cluster"" or ""silo"" or articles that support your primary one.
  5. Reaching out to influencers in your industry when you release new content so they can share it with their followers.

Using content to grow your business is by far one of the most powerful ways to
establish your brand, your authority, and your SEO.

We can't recommend it enough.

### Competitor Research

Competitor research, in SEO, means finding out exactly what your competitors
are doing that is bringing them organic success - and then using that
information as a starting point to craft your strategy.

Here at [SERP Co](http://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud), we like to
start by Googling our main keyword goals and seeing who is ranking.

We then put them into a tool, like Ahrefs, that shows us what [keywords they
are ranking](https://devinschumacher.com/keyword-rank-tracking-tools/) for,
where they are getting their links, and how much traffic they are getting.

We can then add them to a list and then repeat the process until we have a
nice spreadsheet/database of competitors that we can track, monitor & build
off of.

**If you want help with competitor SEO research, monitoring & reverse
engineering - you will need these 2 tools:**

  1. [Ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com)
  2. [SERP App](https://serp.app)

Some examples of Competitor Research for SEO:

  1. Create a list of the products & services you offer.
  2. Create a list of some common questions/search queries people could use to potentially find your website.
  3. Search these keywords on Google.
  4. Compile a list of websites that are currently ranking for the keyword terms you want - these are your [""SERP](https://devinschumacher.com/serp/) Competitors"" or ""SEO Competitors.
  5. Add the 

### Keyword Research

[Keyword research](https://devinschumacher.com/keyword-research/) is the art &
science of meticulously finding, sorting, categorizing & planning out the
content relevant to your niche based on keywords that people are already
searching for.

Really the entire point of SEO is to bring people to _your brand's products &
services at the moment the consumer is searching_ for a solution to their
problem (that your company solves).

Most of the time they don't know about YOU, but they know what their issue is.

**Enter keyword research** :

content/uploads/2022/08/download-1-2.gif)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/download-1-2.gif)

We can use tools to find the keywords people are searching for, and then write
content specifically designed to solve those problems, answer those questions,
and provide solutions to the issues the searches have.

For example, we didn't pull the keyword ""SEO Techniques"" out of thin air when
deciding to write this article.

We first found out how many people are searching for this per month (more than
7,000 searches per month globally, and close to 2,000 per month in the USA)

### Local SEO

Does your business serve customers in a specific geographic area? Maybe at
your office, or maybe you travel to the homes/workplace of your customer?

If so, you're going to want to put some serious emphasis on your [Local SEO
strategy](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/).

Local SEO is the skillset that will help drive a ton of traffic for your local
business through placement in the maps, and by showing up for any search term
that is geographically relevant.

**Some examples of searches that would highly benefit from local seo:**

  * ""personal injury lawyer los angeles""
  * ""dentist near me""
  * ""emergency plumber in philadelphia""
  * ""good italian restaurants""
  * etc.

Showing up in maps is a huge driver of traffic for many businesses.

We have been able to help one of our [Landscape
Marketing](https://devinschumacher.com/landscape-marketing-ideas/) clients in
New York with the Local SEO portion of their digital marketing, and it's
driving a good portion of leads to her business each month:

### Off Page SEO

Off-Page SEO is where the magic happens. Or at least where everyone says the
magic happens.

It's definitely the ""sexy"" part of SEO, and certainly, in the top 3 most
powerful things you can do to get your site ranking on Page 1.

Getting other websites to link to you is basically like those websites telling
Google ""we trust this website, please send some of _our_ authority over to
them.""

Link building is critical for the success of your SEO campaign but is
something you should do after you have done keyword research, competitor
research, content creation, site structure optimization, technical
optimizations & even on [page seo](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/)
optimizations.

It's really one of the last things you do, but also one of the highest impact.

 **Some off-page SEO strategies are:**

  * Setting up the social profile foundations for your business (Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Google My Business, etc).
  * Building links to your website from business directories (Yelp, Yellowpages, MapQuest, etc).
  * Getting your business mentioned on relevant industry blogs & news sites.
  * Participating in other people's podcasts, interviews, guest posting, and other forms of content creation for another brand that they will subsequently post on their website and mention/link to you.

Check out our [Off Page SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/off-page-seo/) module
to become a pro in all things ""off-page.

### On Page SEO

On-Page SEO is a sub-speciality of SEO that involves making sure everything on
a specific web page of your site is fully optimized for search engine crawlers
to get a crystal clear picture of what the page is about.

 **Some examples of On Page SEO Techniques are:**

  * Put your primary keyword in the URL of your page/post
  * Put your primary keyword in the HTML [Title Tag](https://devinschumacher.com/title-tags/) of your page/post
  * Get a variation of your primary keyword in the H1 HTML tag 
  * Use secondary & supporting keywords in your H2, H3, H4, etc. HTML tags
  * Include multimedia (images/video/infographics/gifs/etc.) on your page
  * Write comprehensive, high-quality content
  * Avoid having pages with thin content
  * etc.

Check out our On Page SEO module for the full rundown of how to execute this
SEO technique like a pro.

### Schema / Structured Data

Schema (also known as ""structured data"") is the practice of adding meta
information to your website that gives even more information to search engines
about what your website is about.

It's a bit difficult to understand at first, but what you're essentially doing
is attaching a little ""explainer document"" to every page of your site that
provides further info to the algorithms.

You 'create relationships' between what is on your page and what has been set
as ['web standards' but a few main organizations, so the web
crawler](https://devinschumacher.com/web-crawlers/) sees your page and then
sees these ""connections"" and can understand what your page is about with more
certainty.

The set of standards is set at [schema.org](http://schema.org).

 **Some examples of using Structured Data SEO Techniques are:**

  * Adding ""recipe schema"" to a page on your website about recipes.
  * Adding ""person"" schema to your 'team' or 'about' page on your website.
  * Adding a link from your location page to your Google Maps CID so search engines can make a stronger connection that you are the business.

### Technical SEO

If SEO is for nerds, then Technical SEO is for the _super_ nerds.

I happen to be one of those super nerds, and personally I love technical SEO
because it's something very few people can do extremely well - but can really
be the difference between a good SEO campaign and a great SEO campaign.

If you don't have the stomach (or left brain) to want to sit around and learn
all this yourself - don't fret. You can always outsource bits and pieces of
this stuff to highly specialized people and still make your campaigns great
again.

MAGA, but for SEO.

 **Some examples of Technical SEO Techniques:**

  * Improve the PageSpeed of your website
  * Improve the mobile-friendliness of your website
  * Properly implement a [Robots.txt](https://devinschumacher.com/robots-txt/) file
  * Avoid duplicate meta descriptions
  * Set proper canonicals & paginations
  * Avoid keyword cannibalization

### User Experience

User Experience SEO Techniques revolve around optimizing your site for user
signals.

User signals are essentially analytical elements that Google can see (how long
people stay on your site, how many shares your content gets, how many reviews
your business has, how often do people return to your website, etc.) that
gives Google an indication about how much value your website is providing.

Remember, Google's entire goal is to keep its searchers satisfied by finding
websites that sufficiently answer their searcher's questions.

If Google can see that your website is doing a good job of keeping its users
happy, then you will be rewarded with good/better rankings.

 **Some examples of User Experience SEO Techniques are:**

  * Putting contact information in easy to find places
  * Creating content with the user in mind
  * Keeping your website easy to navigate
  * Utilizing heat-maps, scroll tracking & behavioral analytics tools to continually improve your website in places where users are having issues
  * Encouraging people to share & review your content
  * Not annoying users with all your pop-ups (you know who you are)
  * Keeping ads below the fold

### Voice Optimization

By the year  **2020** , 50% of all online  **searches**  will be performed
with  **voice search**. ([source](https://www.dbswebsite.com/blog/trends-in-
voice-search/))

They key difference between voice searches & text searches is simply human
laziness.

Yeah, I said it. You're lazy. I'm lazy too.

Voice searches tend to be questions where text searches tend to be incomplete
sentences, usually just one or two words.

That's why when I am out drinking with friends having an argument over who was
the lead role in the movie ""BIG"" I would type ""Big actor"", but if I was doing
it on a voice search device I would actually ask a question like ""Who was the
main actor in the movie big"".

Why? Because typing takes time and energy - so when we type searches we
usually truncate them into just 1-2 words if possible.

But talking is easy, and most of us talk too much anyway - so we don't mind
asking questions if we can speak it!

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/voice-
optimization2.png)

 **Some Examples of Voice Search SEO Optimization Techniques:**

  * Write your content around long-tail type keywords
  * Use Schema/structured data on your posts/pages
  * Create [topical clusters](https://devinschumacher.com/topical-clustering/) (instead of just single keyword posts)

<h3>Black Hat SEO</h3>

with  <strong>voice search</strong>. (<a href=""https://www.dbswebsite.com/blog/trends-in-
voice-search/"">source</a>)</p>
<p>They key difference between voice searches &amp; text searches is simply human
laziness.</p>
<p>Yeah, I said it. You're lazy. I'm lazy too.</p>
<p>Voice searches tend to be questions where text searches tend to be incomplete
sentences, usually just one or two words.</p>
<p>That's why when I am out drinking with friends having an argument over who was
the lead role in the movie ""BIG"" I would type ""Big actor"", but if I was doing
it on a voice search device I would actually ask a question like ""Who was the
main actor in the movie big"".</p>
<p>Why? Because typing takes time and energy - so when we type searches we
usually truncate them into just 1-2 words if possible.</p>
<p>But talking is easy, and most of us talk too much anyway - so we don't mind
asking questions if we can speak it!</p>

<p><strong>Some Examples of Voice Search SEO Optimization Techniques:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Write your content around long-tail type keywords</li>
<li>Use Schema/structured data on your posts/pages</li>
<li>Create <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/topical-clustering/"">topical clusters</a> (instead of just single keyword posts)</li>
</ul>

to go, what would you use? A map.

In the same way that we humans use maps to give us more information of places
we are exploring, so do [web crawlers](https://devinschumacher.com/web-
crawlers/) use sitemaps as a way to give them more information about the
websites they explore.

In this article we explore **what a sitemap is** , the different **types of
sitemaps** , **how sitemaps work** and **how to best use sitemaps** to your
advantage for positive SEO benefits.

## What is a Sitemap?

Let's start by defining sitemap.

 **Sitemap Definition** : A sitemap (or site map, site tree) is simply a list
of all pages/URLs on a website.

More technically speaking, ""sitemap"" refers to an internet protocol (set of
rules governing the format of data sent over the internet).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxahHF_MD2Q

## Why do you need a sitemap?

Sitemaps provide information to [search
engines](https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/) about your website and
make it easier for them to find & understand all of the pages you have
created. After all, you spent time making a nice website – don't you want
search engines to understand what's on it so they can send relevant traffic to
you?

Remember, search engines use web crawlers to follow
[hyperlinks](https://devinschumacher.com/hyperlinks/) on websites to discover
pages to put in their index, so if your website has a good site structure,
good internal linking, and all pages are accounted for through some kind on
on-site link crawlers should be able to find everything.

But why not make is easier? That's where the sitemap comes into play.

It's a place where crawlers can go and just get a list of everything, instead
of having to look around for it.

Remember in school when you'd get that professor who would just literally tell
you everything that's going to be on the midterm? How awesome was that?

That's how search engine bots feel when you give them a sitemap – keep those
robots happy.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/web-roboots-love-
sitemaps.gif)

## Types of Sitemaps

There are more than one type of sitemap – just like there is more than one
type of map (road maps, topographical maps, climatic maps, political maps,
etc).

Each serve their own purpose, so let's see what they're all about.

  * Visual Sitemaps
  * HTML Sitemaps
  * XML Sitemaps

### Visual Sitemap

A visual sitemap is something that I like to create when planning out new
websites. It's literally just a visual reference for how your website is going
to be structured. They are for humans.

You can use a spreadsheet, mind-mapping tool, or even just pen and paper to
draw out how your website is going to be structured.

#### Visual Sitemap Example

Here is an example of how you might plan out the sitemap for a single-location
dentist website:

[![a visual sitemap example using a dentist
website](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2020-05-09-at-12.19.47-pm-1024x726-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-09-at-12.19.47-PM.png)

### HTML Sitemap

An HTML Sitemap is a page on your website, with a list of all the URLs on the
site.

It is for humans & web crawlers. They allow humans to get a quick overview of
all the pages on a website. And they allow web crawlers one single point of
entry to find all the URLs on the site – without having to spend time and
crawl budget going all over the place to piece everything together.

There are WordPress plugins that will allow you to create these types of pages
very easily.

#### Example HTML Sitemap

Here is an example HTML sitemap we found on
<https://gunlawsuits.org/sitemap/>.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/html-example-
sitemap-1024x805-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/05/html-example-sitemap.png)

### XML Sitemap

Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a filetype that is essentially the same a
plain text file, but that uses custom tags to describe the structure of the
file / document, and define additional features.

XML is a ""markup language"", just like [HTML](https://devinschumacher.com/seo-
html-elements/) (HyperText Markup Language), that we use to create sitemaps
that are specifically designed for search engines to crawl.

They are especially important for very large websites where an HTML sitemap
would be ridiculous.

For example, that the retail giant ""Target"", a quick use of a Google search
engine operator shows us that they have over 5 million URLs indexed:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-search-
operator-on-target.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/google-search-operator-on-target.png)

An HTML sitemap would be ridiculous... 5 million links .... _all on one
page??!_

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/fuhgettaboutit-1024x682-1.jpg)

So in this case you'd want to use an XML sitemap.

Because XML sitemaps are used on very large websites, they are hierarchical –
grouped into sub-sections.

#### Example XML Sitemap

You can usually find a website's XML sitemap by adding these inner URLs at the
end of the root domain:

  * /sitemap_index.xml
  * /sitemap.xml

Here is the [XML Sitemap for SERP
Co](https://devinschumacher.com/sitemap_index.xml)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/serp-co-xml-
sitemap.png)

As you can see this XML sitemap is hierarchical - there are sub-sitemaps
located in the top level /sitemap_index.xml.

XML Sitemaps can be created for your website's posts, pages, videos,
categories, custom post types, etc.

#### How to create an XML sitemap

The easiest way to do this is just use the Yoast plugin.

I'd show you exactly how to do it, but their UI changes more than Trump's mind
so by the time you read this the tutorial would probably be outdated anyways.

And to be honest, they don't make things easy to find. It's a serious pet
peeve. But you can get help in [SERP University](http://serpuniversity.com) if
you need it.

## Sitemap Categories

Just like there are different types of sitemaps, there are different
categories of them as well:

  *  **Standard sitemaps** – Your standard XML sitemap.
  *  **Image sitemaps** – Images are typically included in your standard sitemap, but if you have a ton of them (or maybe are an image based website) then you can [create an image specific sitemap](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/178636).
  *  **Video sitemaps** – Similar to image sitemaps, videos are included in your standard sitemap, but if you have a ton of them you can [create a video specific sitemap](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/80471?hl=en).
  *  **News sitemaps** – News websites need their content to be indexed as fast as possible, because news changes constantly. If you are a news website you can create a [news specific sitemap](https://support.google.com/news/publisher-center/answer/9606710?hl=en&visit_id=637246528542782672-2682807663&rd=1).

## Sitemap Best Practices

Okay so now you know what these things are - let's talk about what you need to
do.

Once you know what kind of website you are building, and have created your
visual sitemap go ahead and build the site.

 **Note** : A sitemap is not a requirement for your website to get indexed, or
to rank in the [SERPs](https://devinschumacher.com/serp/), but they help so
you'd have to be pretty lazy not to implement one.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-4-2.gif)

### Create your Sitemap

  * Once your site is built, install the free Yoast SEO plugin.
  * Create an XML sitemap – this will dynamically update as you add/remove pages

### Submit your Sitemap to Google Search Console

Once your sitemap is created, you want to _submit_ it to Google - you can also
do this with Bing... but who really cares about Bing anyways ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Sitemap Benefits

There are are ton of benefits to having a sitemap, and if you're not convinced
by now to have one, this should push you over the edge:

 **Sitemaps help:**

  * Search engines crawl & index your site.
  * Search engines understand what to crawl.
  * Search engines understand what your site is about – the information on it.
  * Search engines understand when your content was last updated.
  * Search engines understand how often your content is being updated.
  * Search engines more quickly index new content on your website, as it is dynamically added to the XML sitemap.
  * Search engines crawl your website more efficiently.
  * Websites with poor internal linking to get all their pages indexed.
  * Very large sites get more organized.

## Final Thoughts on Sitemaps

That's just about it. Many people tend to overcomplicate this, but it really
is as easy as 1,2,3.

  1. Create the sitemap using a plugin.
  2. Submit your sitemap to Google search console.
  3. 3\. Go eat lunch.

to go, what would you use? A map.</p>
<p>In the same way that we humans use maps to give us more information of places
we are exploring, so do <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/web-
crawlers/"">web crawlers</a> use sitemaps as a way to give them more information about the
websites they explore.</p>
<p>In this article we explore <strong>what a sitemap is</strong> , the different <strong>types of
sitemaps</strong> , <strong>how sitemaps work</strong> and <strong>how to best use sitemaps</strong> to your
advantage for positive SEO benefits.</p>
<h2>What is a Sitemap?</h2>
<p>Let's start by defining sitemap.</p>
<p><strong>Sitemap Definition</strong> : A sitemap (or site map, site tree) is simply a list
of all pages/URLs on a website.</p>
<p>More technically speaking, ""sitemap"" refers to an internet protocol (set of
rules governing the format of data sent over the internet).</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxahHF_MD2Q</p>
<h2>Why do you need a sitemap?</h2>
<p>Sitemaps provide information to <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/"">search
engines</a> about your website and
make it easier for them to find &amp; understand all of the pages you have
created. After all, you spent time making a nice website – don't you want
search engines to understand what's on it so they can send relevant traffic to
you?</p>
<p>Remember, search engines use web crawlers to follow
<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/hyperlinks/"">hyperlinks</a> on websites to discover
pages to put in their index, so if your website has a good site structure,
good internal linking, and all pages are accounted for through some kind on
on-site link crawlers should be able to find everything.</p>
<p>But why not make is easier? That's where the sitemap comes into play.</p>
<p>It's a place where crawlers can go and just get a list of everything, instead
of having to look around for it.</p>
<p>Remember in school when you'd get that professor who would just literally tell
you everything that's going to be on the midterm? How awesome was that?</p>
<p>That's how search engine bots feel when you give them a sitemap – keep those
robots happy.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/web-roboots-love-
sitemaps.gif"" /></p>
<h2>Types of Sitemaps</h2>
<p>There are more than one type of sitemap – just like there is more than one
type of map (road maps, topographical maps, climatic maps, political maps,
etc).</p>
<p>Each serve their own purpose, so let's see what they're all about.</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Sitemaps</li>
<li>HTML Sitemaps</li>
<li>XML Sitemaps</li>
</ul>
<h3>Visual Sitemap</h3>
<p>A visual sitemap is something that I like to create when planning out new
websites. It's literally just a visual reference for how your website is going
to be structured. They are for humans.</p>
<p>You can use a spreadsheet, mind-mapping tool, or even just pen and paper to
draw out how your website is going to be structured.</p>
<h4>Visual Sitemap Example</h4>
<p>Here is an example of how you might plan out the sitemap for a single-location
dentist website:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-09-at-12.19.47-PM.png""><img alt=""a visual sitemap example using a dentist
website"" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2020-05-09-at-12.19.47-pm-1024x726-1.png"" /></a></p>
<h3>HTML Sitemap</h3>
<p>An HTML Sitemap is a page on your website, with a list of all the URLs on the
site.</p>
<p>It is for humans &amp; web crawlers. They allow humans to get a quick overview of
all the pages on a website. And they allow web crawlers one single point of
entry to find all the URLs on the site – without having to spend time and
crawl budget going all over the place to piece everything together.</p>
<p>There are WordPress plugins that will allow you to create these types of pages
very easily.</p>
<h4>Example HTML Sitemap</h4>
<p>Here is an example HTML sitemap we found on
<a href=""https://gunlawsuits.org/sitemap/"">https://gunlawsuits.org/sitemap/</a>.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/05/html-example-sitemap.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/html-example-
sitemap-1024x805-1.png"" /></a></p>
<h3>XML Sitemap</h3>
<p>Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a filetype that is essentially the same a
plain text file, but that uses custom tags to describe the structure of the
file / document, and define additional features.</p>
<p>XML is a ""markup language"", just like <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/seo-
html-elements/"">HTML</a> (HyperText Markup Language), that we use to create sitemaps
that are specifically designed for search engines to crawl.</p>
<p>They are especially important for very large websites where an HTML sitemap
would be ridiculous.</p>
<p>For example, that the retail giant ""Target"", a quick use of a Google search
engine operator shows us that they have over 5 million URLs indexed:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/google-search-operator-on-target.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-search-
operator-on-target.png"" /></a></p>
<p>An HTML sitemap would be ridiculous... 5 million links .... <em>all on one
page??!</em></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/fuhgettaboutit-1024x682-1.jpg"" /></p>
<p>So in this case you'd want to use an XML sitemap.</p>
<p>Because XML sitemaps are used on very large websites, they are hierarchical –
grouped into sub-sections.</p>
<h4>Example XML Sitemap</h4>
<p>You can usually find a website's XML sitemap by adding these inner URLs at the
end of the root domain:</p>
<ul>
<li>/sitemap_index.xml</li>
<li>/sitemap.xml</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/sitemap_index.xml"">XML Sitemap for SERP
Co</a></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/serp-co-xml-
sitemap.png"" /></p>
<p>As you can see this XML sitemap is hierarchical - there are sub-sitemaps
located in the top level /sitemap_index.xml.</p>
<p>XML Sitemaps can be created for your website's posts, pages, videos,
categories, custom post types, etc.</p>
<h4>How to create an XML sitemap</h4>
<p>The easiest way to do this is just use the Yoast plugin.</p>
<p>I'd show you exactly how to do it, but their UI changes more than Trump's mind
so by the time you read this the tutorial would probably be outdated anyways.</p>
<p>And to be honest, they don't make things easy to find. It's a serious pet
peeve. But you can get help in <a href=""http://serpuniversity.com"">SERP University</a> if
you need it.</p>
<h2>Sitemap Categories</h2>
<p>Just like there are different types of sitemaps, there are different
categories of them as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard sitemaps</strong> – Your standard XML sitemap.</li>
<li><strong>Image sitemaps</strong> – Images are typically included in your standard sitemap, but if you have a ton of them (or maybe are an image based website) then you can <a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/178636"">create an image specific sitemap</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Video sitemaps</strong> – Similar to image sitemaps, videos are included in your standard sitemap, but if you have a ton of them you can <a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/80471?hl=en"">create a video specific sitemap</a>.</li>
<li><strong>News sitemaps</strong> – News websites need their content to be indexed as fast as possible, because news changes constantly. If you are a news website you can create a <a href=""https://support.google.com/news/publisher-center/answer/9606710?hl=en&amp;visit_id=637246528542782672-2682807663&amp;rd=1"">news specific sitemap</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sitemap Best Practices</h2>
<p>Okay so now you know what these things are - let's talk about what you need to
do.</p>
<p>Once you know what kind of website you are building, and have created your
visual sitemap go ahead and build the site.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> : A sitemap is not a requirement for your website to get indexed, or
to rank in the <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/serp/"">SERPs</a>, but they help so
you'd have to be pretty lazy not to implement one.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-4-2.gif"" /></p>
<h3>Create your Sitemap</h3>
<ul>
<li>Once your site is built, install the free Yoast SEO plugin.</li>
<li>Create an XML sitemap – this will dynamically update as you add/remove pages</li>
</ul>
<h3>Submit your Sitemap to Google Search Console</h3>
<p>Once your sitemap is created, you want to <em>submit</em> it to Google - you can also
do this with Bing... but who really cares about Bing anyways ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯</p>
<p>Go to <a href=""https://search.google.com/search-console"">Google Search Console</a> &gt;
Sitemaps &gt; Submit.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/submit-sitemap-to-

<p>After Google has crawled your sitemap, you can find errors by clicking the
“Submitted Sitemaps” area:</p>

This article is for non-developers who need to understand the importance
because they want their websites to get better visibility, acquire more
organic traffic, and make more money.

I wholeheartedly promise to make it not boring. And to prove that to you, I
will start it off with a semi-relevant joke:

 _I wonder what my parents did to fight boredom before the internet? I asked
my 15 brothers and sisters and they didn’t know either_.

## What are Web Crawlers?

Let's start by defining web crawler.

 **Web crawlers** (also called 'spiders', 'bots', 'spiderbots', etc.) are
software applications whose primary directive in life is to navigate (crawl)
around the internet and collect information, most commonly for the purpose of
indexing that information somewhere.

They're called ""web crawlers"" because _crawling_ is actually the technical
term for automatically accessing a website to obtain data using software.
Essentially, a crawler is kind of like a virtual librarian. It looks for info
on the internet, and then sends it to a database for organizing, cataloguing,
etc. so that the crawled information is quickly & easily retrievable by search
engines when needed (like when you perform a search).

Most people call web crawlers either crawlers, bots, or spiders.

I really don't think many people call them spiderbots, but it's fun to say.

 **Spiderbot**! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to never-
endingly roam the extraordinarily large (and continuously expanding) internet
and collect all its information, and put it into our index. Now go forth,
acquire & extract!

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/web-crawler-
mission-impossible.gif)

That's pretty much how it works.

Now, who the F in their right mind would want to go through the internet and
catalogue all that information? It sounds like the punishment that would be
given to the utmost of sinners, by Lucifer himself.

**Enter** : Googlebot.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/googlebot.png)

That's Googlebot: He/she/it is a never-ending robot (piece of software) who
runs around the internet and takes all your information (the information from
your website, the information you load onto [social
media](https://devinschumacher.com/social-media-management-tools/) websites,
the information you send in your Gmails, the information you speak into your
Google Home, etc.) and sends it into the Google index. This is [how search
engines work](https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/).

Google isn't the only one though – other search engine companies (like Yahoo,
Bing, etc.) make their money by providing information to us people glued to
our computers and phones searching things 24/7 – but they need to acquire that
information some how. They do with this **web crawlers**.

## How do Web Crawlers Work?

The primary goal of a web crawler is to create an index (more in this later)
and to learn what every web page on the internet is about, so the information
can be retrieved by [search engines](https://devinschumacher.com/search-
engines/) and provided to you (the searcher) extremely quickly, and with great
accuracy – meaning providing you results that answer the [search
intent](https://devinschumacher.com/search-intent/) of whatever it is you
typed (or spoke) into the search engine.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHRy6jTf5II&ab_channel=devinschumacher

The internet is like a continuously growing library with billions of books
(websites), but no official/central filing system. So, search engine companies
use internet-based software known as web crawlers to discover _publicly
available webpages_ \- like your website.

## An overview of the process of web crawling

Web crawlers systematically browse the internet to find websites. But how do
they find all different websites? And how do they find all the pages on your
website?

  *  **Crawling Links** : Web crawlers follow [hyperlinks](https://devinschumacher.com/hyperlinks/), much like we humans do when we are browsing the web ourselves, to go from page to page – or one website to another. These could be internal links to go from page to page on one site, or [backlinks](https://devinschumacher.com/backlinks/) to go from website A to website B.
  *  **Crawling Sitemaps**[:](https://devinschumacher.com/sitemaps/) Web crawlers also take a look at your website's sitemap to understand all the pages it needs to visit and index.
  *  **Manual Submission** : You can manually submit your website, and a list of its pages, to search engines using tools like Google Search Console, Bing Webmaster Tools, etc.

Then, they copy the information on the web pages they find (text, HTML,
hyperlinks, metadata, etc.) and send it their search engine mothership (the
web crawler's company servers) which download the webpages into their enormous
databases and organize / index the information in a way that it can be
searched and referenced very quickly.

Was that definitely 100% technically accurate? I don't know. I'm not a web
developer. But it's close enough for you to get the overall idea of how it
works without you having to re-read the definition 17 times and still be
confused.

We aren't trying to be that website where you read something like:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/wtf-did-i-just-
read......jpg)

Anyways – web crawlers send information into Google's database in a way that
it can be accessed by you (searchers) very quickly.

When crawlers find a webpage, the search engine's systems render the page
content taking note of key elements like [keywords and we keep
track](https://devinschumacher.com/keyword-rank-tracking-tools/) everything it
the Search index.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/organizing-
information-by-indexing.png)

This technology is called ""indexing"".

Historically, Google's entire search engine index / algorithm ran on using
[keywords](https://devinschumacher.com/seo-keywords/) to understand, index,
organize and serve pages (when someone performed a search).

That's why when you search for something on Google it can somehow return
4,220,000,000 results of information in less than half a second... Absolute
Insanity.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/googles-index-
returns-searches-fast.png)

 **Note** : this process of visiting pages, crawling around all of the links,
downloading the information, etc. is all happening on **your website** , which
means **your web server (aka web host)** is the one who has to process
information and it uses **your** **resources** , which web-hosts will charge
you for.

So, not only is Google making you spend money to essentially ""steal and
organize"" your information, they then make you to pay them to advertise if you
want your website to show up at the top of the search page. Think about that
for a second...

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-4-1.gif)

That's why at my agency SERP, we provide SEO Services with pride - and see it
as a battle against the giants. A way for us to help the little guys take back
what is theirs – organic search engine real estate, where you don't have to
PAY for clicks.

I digress. Back to web crawling.

#### Improved Web Crawling, Improved Indexing

Now, however, Google is evolving and being able to create more sophisticated
and complex understanding of information.

Instead of simply organizing information on webpages by keywords, it is now
able to understand _entities_ – the ""same"" we us humans do.

For example, the keyword phrase ""nicholas cage"" was simply a string of 12
letters separated by a space.

Now, Google understands more about this keyword, the [reasons people search
for it](https://devinschumacher.com/search-intent/), and that Nicholas Cage is
an _entity –  _specifically a person entity.

So when you search for nicholas cage you are provided with more information
about him, as a person.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nicholas-cage-
knolwedge-graph.png)

You can read more about this process our article about
[SERP](https://devinschumacher.com/serp/) features.

### Web Crawler Policies

Since web crawlers are software, they follow rules, known as policies.

  *  **Selection policies** – tell crawlers _what_ pages to download, and which ones to not download
  *  **Re-visit policies** – tell crawlers _when_ to go back check for changes.
  *  **Politeness policies**  – tell crawlers how to avoid overloading web sites. Hint: you have some power here by giving them instructions in your [robots.txt file](https://devinschumacher.com/robots-txt/).

There are more policies but ... I'm already getting bored talking about them,
so let's get back to what's important here.

## The importance of web crawlers for SEO

[Search engine optimization](https://devinschumacher.com/what-is-seo/) – the
practice of preparing content for search engine _indexing_ so your website
shows up higher in [SERP](https://devinschumacher.com/serp/) results, and you
get more clicks, traffic, sales, etc.

Without web crawlers your site would never be found, and thus unable to be
presented on search engines.

## Selectivity

 _Most_ crawlers don't attempt to crawl the entirety of the Internet, because
let's face it – some website's are more important than others, and the
internet is just way too big.

Web crawlers (remember they are software) require _resources_ (aka money) to
run, so companies want to make sure they are using their resources as
efficiently as possible, so they must be selective.

 **These bots decide which pages to crawl first based factors they deem to be
important:**

  * How popular is the site? They need to keep crawling it if they want the updated information the site continues to publish to be accessible from a search engine.
  * Popularity is determined by [hundreds of ranking factors](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/), but the main ones are: Traffic, # of links to the page, etc.

## Crawl Budget

A web crawlers ""crawl budget"" is basically the amount of pages it will crawl
(and index) on any given website during a given timeframe.

What does this mean for you? If your site is too slow, too hard to crawl,
deemed not important enough, etc. you will run out of your budget and the
crawler will leave. It will miss finding pages, and thus your pages wont be
indexed in search engines.

So, as an SEO specialist, you want to make sure you optimize your website to
maximize crawl budget.

**Do this by having:**

  * A good sitemap
  * Good website architecture
  * Good Page Speed
  * Lots of [backlinks](https://devinschumacher.com/backlinks/)
  * Good [internal linking](https://devinschumacher.com/internal-links/)
  * A properly setup [robots.txt file](https://devinschumacher.com/robots-txt/)
  * Making sure your website does not have alot of broken pages (404s, etc.)

## Robots.txt

Your robots.txt file is a file on your website that crawlers look at for
directives – you can invite the spiders in, or keep them out – the choice is
yours.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-5-1.gif)

We have an article extensively covering robots.txt, but just to recap – you
may not want bots visiting certain pages (maximize your crawl budget on your
more important website sections) or maybe you just want to block _certain
bots_.

What certain bots you ask? The bad kind of bots.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-6-1.gif)

## Good Bots vs. Bad Bots

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/bots-vs-.jpg)

So we want our website to be found by Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc. so our
business can be found by customers and grow. Great.

And now we know that in order for your website to be found we must make sure
that these crawler bots are finding our website. Great.

But not all web crawlers are programs created by the search engine companies,
and not all bots are deployed around the internet to INDEX content – some are
here to _scrape content_.

### What are scraper bots?

Ever got spam phone calls? spam emails? How did these people get your contact
information? Well, one way was that it was scraped off your website, or some
website, on the internet.

Ever wonder how your business/personal information ends up on websites where
you know for certain you didn't add it? Might have been scraped.

Bots can scrape anything posted publicly on the Internet. Anything includes
text, images, HTML, CSS, etc.

Malicious bots can collect all sorts of information that hackers/attackers use
for a variety of purposes:

  * Text based content can be reused on another website to steal the first website's SERP rankings
  * Attackers could use your website's entire HTML & CSS code to create a duplicate of your site and try to deceive users to inputting their usernames, passwords, credit card information, etc. 
  * etc.

Personal information can be scraped in bulk to collect databases of people in
a specific cohort, and used for marketing purposes. Admittedly, this is not
nearly as malicious as the previous examples but it still illustrates the
point – not all bots are here to index your content for search engines.

 **Fun Fact** : Bots are believed to make up over 40% of all internet traffic!

Not only is that a staggering amount of bot related activity, it has real
implications for you as a website owner. It affects your analytics, your
server resources, etc.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/infographic-good-
bots-vs-bad-bots.png)

Since this article isn't about malicious bots (we could have an entire series
on that) I will stop there with it.

## Final Thoughts

Hate it or love it, bots are everywhere. Web crawlers make up almost half the
internet, so to be a responsible business owner, website owner, SEO
consultant, etc. it is critical we understand them and continue to learn about
what we can do to let the good ones in, and keep the bad ones out.

and to learn what every web page on the internet is about, so the information
can be retrieved by <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/search-
engines/"">search engines</a> and provided to you (the searcher) extremely quickly, and with great
accuracy – meaning providing you results that answer the <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/search-intent/"">search
intent</a> of whatever it is you
typed (or spoke) into the search engine.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHRy6jTf5II&amp;ab_channel=devinschumacher</p>
<p>The internet is like a continuously growing library with billions of books
(websites), but no official/central filing system. So, search engine companies
use internet-based software known as web crawlers to discover <em>publicly
available webpages</em> - like your website.</p>
<h2>An overview of the process of web crawling</h2>
<p>Web crawlers systematically browse the internet to find websites. But how do
they find all different websites? And how do they find all the pages on your
website?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crawling Links</strong> : Web crawlers follow <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/hyperlinks/"">hyperlinks</a>, much like we humans do when we are browsing the web ourselves, to go from page to page – or one website to another. These could be internal links to go from page to page on one site, or <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/backlinks/"">backlinks</a> to go from website A to website B.</li>
<li><strong>Crawling Sitemaps</strong><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/sitemaps/"">:</a> Web crawlers also take a look at your website's sitemap to understand all the pages it needs to visit and index.</li>
<li><strong>Manual Submission</strong> : You can manually submit your website, and a list of its pages, to search engines using tools like Google Search Console, Bing Webmaster Tools, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, they copy the information on the web pages they find (text, HTML,
hyperlinks, metadata, etc.) and send it their search engine mothership (the
web crawler's company servers) which download the webpages into their enormous
databases and organize / index the information in a way that it can be
searched and referenced very quickly.</p>
<p>Was that definitely 100% technically accurate? I don't know. I'm not a web
developer. But it's close enough for you to get the overall idea of how it
works without you having to re-read the definition 17 times and still be
confused.</p>
<p>We aren't trying to be that website where you read something like:</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/wtf-did-i-just-
read......jpg"" /></p>
<p>Anyways – web crawlers send information into Google's database in a way that
it can be accessed by you (searchers) very quickly.</p>
<p>When crawlers find a webpage, the search engine's systems render the page
content taking note of key elements like <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/keyword-rank-tracking-tools/"">keywords and we keep
track</a> everything it
the Search index.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/organizing-
information-by-indexing.png"" /></p>
<p>This technology is called ""indexing"".</p>
<p>Historically, Google's entire search engine index / algorithm ran on using
<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/seo-keywords/"">keywords</a> to understand, index,
organize and serve pages (when someone performed a search).</p>
<p>That's why when you search for something on Google it can somehow return
4,220,000,000 results of information in less than half a second... Absolute
Insanity.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/googles-index-
returns-searches-fast.png"" /></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> : this process of visiting pages, crawling around all of the links,
downloading the information, etc. is all happening on <strong>your website</strong> , which
means <strong>your web server (aka web host)</strong> is the one who has to process
information and it uses <strong>your</strong> <strong>resources</strong> , which web-hosts will charge
you for.</p>
<p>So, not only is Google making you spend money to essentially ""steal and
organize"" your information, they then make you to pay them to advertise if you
want your website to show up at the top of the search page. Think about that
for a second...</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-4-1.gif"" /></p>
<p>That's why at my agency SERP, we provide SEO Services with pride - and see it
as a battle against the giants. A way for us to help the little guys take back
what is theirs – organic search engine real estate, where you don't have to
PAY for clicks.</p>
<p>I digress. Back to web crawling.</p>
<h4>Improved Web Crawling, Improved Indexing</h4>
<p>Now, however, Google is evolving and being able to create more sophisticated
and complex understanding of information.</p>
<p>Instead of simply organizing information on webpages by keywords, it is now
able to understand <em>entities</em> – the ""same"" we us humans do.</p>
<p>For example, the keyword phrase ""nicholas cage"" was simply a string of 12
letters separated by a space.</p>
<p>Now, Google understands more about this keyword, the <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/search-intent/"">reasons people search
for it</a>, and that Nicholas Cage is
an _entity –  _specifically a person entity.</p>
<p>So when you search for nicholas cage you are provided with more information
about him, as a person.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nicholas-cage-
knolwedge-graph.png"" /></p>
<p>You can read more about this process our article about
<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/serp/"">SERP</a> features.</p>
<h3>Web Crawler Policies</h3>
<p>Since web crawlers are software, they follow rules, known as policies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Selection policies</strong> – tell crawlers <em>what</em> pages to download, and which ones to not download</li>
<li><strong>Re-visit policies</strong> – tell crawlers <em>when</em> to go back check for changes.</li>
<li><strong>Politeness policies</strong>  – tell crawlers how to avoid overloading web sites. Hint: you have some power here by giving them instructions in your <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/robots-txt/"">robots.txt file</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are more policies but ... I'm already getting bored talking about them,
so let's get back to what's important here.</p>
<h2>The importance of web crawlers for SEO</h2>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/what-is-seo/"">Search engine optimization</a> – the
practice of preparing content for search engine <em>indexing</em> so your website
shows up higher in <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/serp/"">SERP</a> results, and you
get more clicks, traffic, sales, etc.</p>
<p>Without web crawlers your site would never be found, and thus unable to be
presented on search engines.</p>
<h2>Selectivity</h2>
<p><em>Most</em> crawlers don't attempt to crawl the entirety of the Internet, because
let's face it – some website's are more important than others, and the
internet is just way too big.</p>
<p>Web crawlers (remember they are software) require <em>resources</em> (aka money) to
run, so companies want to make sure they are using their resources as
efficiently as possible, so they must be selective.</p>
<p><strong>These bots decide which pages to crawl first based factors they deem to be
important:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How popular is the site? They need to keep crawling it if they want the updated information the site continues to publish to be accessible from a search engine.</li>
<li>Popularity is determined by <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/"">hundreds of ranking factors</a>, but the main ones are: Traffic, # of links to the page, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Crawl Budget</h2>
<p>A web crawlers ""crawl budget"" is basically the amount of pages it will crawl
(and index) on any given website during a given timeframe.</p>
<p>What does this mean for you? If your site is too slow, too hard to crawl,
deemed not important enough, etc. you will run out of your budget and the
crawler will leave. It will miss finding pages, and thus your pages wont be
indexed in search engines.</p>
<p>So, as an SEO specialist, you want to make sure you optimize your website to
maximize crawl budget.</p>
<p><strong>Do this by having:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A good sitemap</li>
<li>Good website architecture</li>
<li>Good Page Speed</li>
<li>Lots of <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/backlinks/"">backlinks</a></li>
<li>Good <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/internal-links/"">internal linking</a></li>
<li>A properly setup <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/robots-txt/"">robots.txt file</a></li>
<li>Making sure your website does not have alot of broken pages (404s, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Robots.txt</h2>
<p>Your robots.txt file is a file on your website that crawlers look at for
directives – you can invite the spiders in, or keep them out – the choice is
yours.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-5-1.gif"" /></p>
<p>We have an article extensively covering robots.txt, but just to recap – you
may not want bots visiting certain pages (maximize your crawl budget on your
more important website sections) or maybe you just want to block <em>certain
bots</em>.</p>
<p>What certain bots you ask? The bad kind of bots.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-6-1.gif"" /></p>
<h2>Good Bots vs. Bad Bots</h2>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/bots-vs-.jpg"" /></p>
<p>So we want our website to be found by Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc. so our
business can be found by customers and grow. Great.</p>
<p>And now we know that in order for your website to be found we must make sure
that these crawler bots are finding our website. Great.</p>
<p>But not all web crawlers are programs created by the search engine companies,
and not all bots are deployed around the internet to INDEX content – some are
here to <em>scrape content</em>.</p>
<h3>What are scraper bots?</h3>
<p>Ever got spam phone calls? spam emails? How did these people get your contact
information? Well, one way was that it was scraped off your website, or some
website, on the internet.</p>
<p>Ever wonder how your business/personal information ends up on websites where
you know for certain you didn't add it? Might have been scraped.</p>
<p>Bots can scrape anything posted publicly on the Internet. Anything includes
text, images, HTML, CSS, etc.</p>
<p>Malicious bots can collect all sorts of information that hackers/attackers use
for a variety of purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text based content can be reused on another website to steal the first website's SERP rankings</li>
<li>Attackers could use your website's entire HTML &amp; CSS code to create a duplicate of your site and try to deceive users to inputting their usernames, passwords, credit card information, etc. </li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personal information can be scraped in bulk to collect databases of people in
a specific cohort, and used for marketing purposes. Admittedly, this is not
nearly as malicious as the previous examples but it still illustrates the
point – not all bots are here to index your content for search engines.</p>
<p><strong>Fun Fact</strong> : Bots are believed to make up over 40% of all internet traffic!</p>
<p>Not only is that a staggering amount of bot related activity, it has real
implications for you as a website owner. It affects your analytics, your
server resources, etc.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/infographic-good-
bots-vs-bad-bots.png"" /></p>
<p>Since this article isn't about malicious bots (we could have an entire series
on that) I will stop there with it.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Hate it or love it, bots are everywhere. Web crawlers make up almost half the
internet, so to be a responsible business owner, website owner, SEO
consultant, etc. it is critical we understand them and continue to learn about
what we can do to let the good ones in, and keep the bad ones out.</p>

engines](https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/)_, and **search queries**
are the text strings people type into them.

Understanding the different types of search queries, and how to properly
structure your content strategy around them, is exactly what we do to get
2x,3x,5x and even 10x traffic growth in short periods of time for our client
websites – understand & master these and your website traffic will skyrocket.

## What Are Search Queries?

Let's start out by **defining search query**. A **search query** is a string
of text that someone types into a [search
engine](https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/), using various
combinations of [keywords](https://devinschumacher.com/seo-keywords/), in
order to receive a list of results (called a
[SERP](https://devinschumacher.com/serp/)) with various information that is
intended to help provide them answers.

Search clearly refers to ""search engine"", and ""query"" refers to ""question"" –
consumers have questions, search engines provide answers to those questions.

## Types of Search Queries

Not all searches are created equal. People will search different things
depending on where they are in their particular buying journey.

**The main types of search queries are:**

  *  **Informational** – Informational search queries are entered with the intent of gathering more information on a particular topic, without necessarily any intention to make a transaction. For example ""when was Kevin Costner born"".
  * Navigational – Navigational search queries are entered with the intent of finding particulars websites. For example, you can't remember the exact URL for the account login page of Chase bank, you might type ""chase login page"".
  * Transactional – Transactional search queries typically are more valuable (from an advertising perspective) because they are the things that people type when they are closer to actually pulling out their wallets and buying something, for example, ""emergency dentist near me"".

### Buyer's Journey

The buyer's journey refers to the series of stages a consumer goes through
from the beginning of the research phase to the time when they make a
purchase.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/buyer-journey-
funel-889x1024-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/04/buyer-journey-funel.png)

In the beginning, you will typically start with identifying a problem that you
have – for example, let's say you are a dentist and you need more patients.
You have identified a problem – more patients.

You may start searching things like ""how do I grow my dental practice"", and in
doing so you stumble across this cool concept called [""digital
marketing""](https://devinschumacher.com/digital-marketing-for-dummies/). This
would be a search very early in your buyers' journey. You are not ready to
buy, you are simply researching. This is referred to as ""top of the funnel"",
funnel referring to the series of steps you go through in your journey.

So, now that you understand your problem and have **awareness** of a potential
solution, you will want to research this solution further. So, you then search
something like ""[digital marketing ideas for
dentists](https://devinschumacher.com/dental-marketing-ideas/)"".

You find a cool article about it and are now **interested** in learning more
about how to do it yourself, or you realize that you want to hire a [dental
marketing company](https://devinschumacher.com/services/marketing/dental/).

If you want to begin to **consider** which company to hire, you may search
something like ""[top dental marketing
companies](https://devinschumacher.com/services/marketing/dental/)"".

As you can probably see from this short example, each of these is a search
query – but they all have a different intention behind them for the searcher
(aka [search intent](https://devinschumacher.com/search-intent/)).

As a website owner, if you can match your content strategy with the correct
level of buyer search intent you will be well on your way to growing your
business from web traffic.

Check out our article on [search intent](https://devinschumacher.com/search-
intent/) for more specifics on types of search queries.

## Google Search Queries

Now let's talk about Google search queries – because Google rules the search
game.

Up to this point we have discussed basic types of search queries, but what
about the advanced stuff?

We have an entire article dedicated to these, but for now let's give you the
quick version on them.

Google advanced search engine operators are ways to type search queries into
Google using ""extra stuff"". Extra stuff like + signs, search query modifiers,
etc.

For example – let's say you wanted to see how competitive it would be to rank
for ""[the best digital marketing agency](http://staging-
devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud)"", so you Google it:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/advanced-google-
search-operator-one.png)

Wow... 541 MILLION results. Do you really want to compete against that? No,
you don't.

But, since you have spent some time to [learn SEO at SERP
University](http://serp.university) you know that if you have a page on your
website dedicated to this term with the [exact seed
keyword](https://devinschumacher.com/seed-keywords/) in the [page
title](https://devinschumacher.com/title-tags/), you have a way better chance
to rank for it.

So you want to know ""how many of these pages who [rank for that search
actually have the exact keyword](https://devinschumacher.com/keyword-rank-
tracking-tools/) in their page title?"" – you would need to use the
**allintitle** advanced search operator.

No, your search query looks like this: allintitle the best digital marketing
agency

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/all-in-title-
advanced-google-search-operator.png)

This particular search query is only going to show you results who have this
combination of words somewhere in their page title. In this case, that is
4,140 results – much better to try and compete with that than 541,000,000 –
wouldn't you say?

However, this is just going to find all the results with those words SOMEWHERE
in the page title, not necessarily in that order.

Now can even go one step further because we are advanced SEOs here. We know
that by putting the keyword string exactly in our page title is actually going
to be better, so let's use a variation of that advanced search operator to
find all of the results that have this [longtail
keyword](https://devinschumacher.com/long-tail-keywords/) in the exact order
in their page title – we need to use the allintitle advanced search engine
operator WITH quotations.

Like so:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/all-entitle-phrase-
match-advanced-google-search-engine-operator.png)

Check it out, only 2,030 results! That's more like it.

By understanding advanced Google search engine operators, we can be much more
granular and scientific about how we approach which terms we want to rent for
my truly understanding more details on the competitiveness of those terms.

Check out our dedicated article on this topic for a more comprehensive look at
all of the advanced Google search engine operators.

## Final Thoughts

It is not enough to simply write articles around keywords and hope that people
will find your website and receive the type of content that they need.

You absolutely have to be matching your content strategy to the search intent
of keywords in order to provide the best possible resources for individuals
that will rank in search and help guide them down their buyers' journey to
ultimately making a decision to purchase something with your company.","<p><em>Roughly 93% of all web traffic comes through<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/"">search
engines</a></em>, and <strong>search queries</strong>
are the text strings people type into them.</p>
<p>Understanding the different types of search queries, and how to properly
structure your content strategy around them, is exactly what we do to get
2x,3x,5x and even 10x traffic growth in short periods of time for our client
websites – understand &amp; master these and your website traffic will skyrocket.</p>
<h2>What Are Search Queries?</h2>
<p>Let's start out by <strong>defining search query</strong>. A <strong>search query</strong> is a string
of text that someone types into a <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/"">search
engine</a>, using various
combinations of <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/seo-keywords/"">keywords</a>, in
order to receive a list of results (called a
<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/serp/"">SERP</a>) with various information that is
intended to help provide them answers.</p>
<p>Search clearly refers to ""search engine"", and ""query"" refers to ""question"" –
consumers have questions, search engines provide answers to those questions.</p>
<h2>Types of Search Queries</h2>
<p>Not all searches are created equal. People will search different things
depending on where they are in their particular buying journey.</p>
<p><strong>The main types of search queries are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Informational</strong> – Informational search queries are entered with the intent of gathering more information on a particular topic, without necessarily any intention to make a transaction. For example ""when was Kevin Costner born"".</li>
<li>Navigational – Navigational search queries are entered with the intent of finding particulars websites. For example, you can't remember the exact URL for the account login page of Chase bank, you might type ""chase login page"".</li>
<li>Transactional – Transactional search queries typically are more valuable (from an advertising perspective) because they are the things that people type when they are closer to actually pulling out their wallets and buying something, for example, ""emergency dentist near me"".</li>
</ul>
<h3>Buyer's Journey</h3>
<p>The buyer's journey refers to the series of stages a consumer goes through
from the beginning of the research phase to the time when they make a
purchase.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/04/buyer-journey-funel.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/buyer-journey-
funel-889x1024-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>In the beginning, you will typically start with identifying a problem that you
have – for example, let's say you are a dentist and you need more patients.
You have identified a problem – more patients.</p>
<p>You may start searching things like ""how do I grow my dental practice"", and in
doing so you stumble across this cool concept called <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/digital-marketing-for-dummies/"">""digital
marketing""</a>. This
would be a search very early in your buyers' journey. You are not ready to
buy, you are simply researching. This is referred to as ""top of the funnel"",
funnel referring to the series of steps you go through in your journey.</p>
<p>So, now that you understand your problem and have <strong>awareness</strong> of a potential
solution, you will want to research this solution further. So, you then search
something like ""<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/dental-marketing-ideas/"">digital marketing ideas for
dentists</a>"".</p>
<p>You find a cool article about it and are now <strong>interested</strong> in learning more
about how to do it yourself, or you realize that you want to hire a <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/services/marketing/dental/"">dental
marketing company</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to begin to <strong>consider</strong> which company to hire, you may search
something like ""<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/services/marketing/dental/"">top dental marketing
companies</a>"".</p>
<p>As you can probably see from this short example, each of these is a search
query – but they all have a different intention behind them for the searcher
(aka <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/search-intent/"">search intent</a>).</p>
<p>As a website owner, if you can match your content strategy with the correct
level of buyer search intent you will be well on your way to growing your
business from web traffic.</p>
<p>Check out our article on <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/search-
intent/"">search intent</a> for more specifics on types of search queries.</p>
<h2>Google Search Queries</h2>
<p>Now let's talk about Google search queries – because Google rules the search
game.</p>
<p>Up to this point we have discussed basic types of search queries, but what
about the advanced stuff?</p>

  *  **SERP Features** – what SERP features are, and the different types.
  *  **SERP Tools** – the most useful tools for mastering the SERPs.

## What is a SERP?

""What does SERP stand for?"" – A question we get asked a lot, as you can
probably imagine.

 **SERP Definition** : ""SERP"" is an acronym for ""Search Engine Results Page"",
or ""Search Engine Result Pages"".

Colloquially the meaning of SERP is really used to describe any set of results
that you get as a consumer after ""searching"" something using a [search
engine](https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/).

Your [search intent](https://devinschumacher.com/search-intent/), and the
device you ask your question on, will determine what type of SERP you get
back.

## The Importance of SERPs

SERPs are probably the most widely utilized things that people don't have a
name for. Let's be honest, outside of the [SEO
community](http://serp.university) most people don't know what SERP stands
for, or that it's even an acronym at all.

But the amount of people who have seen and interacted with a SERP is
staggering.

That's pretty much everyone who has ever used the internet.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-16-1.gif)

 **People Numbers** :

  * World Population (as of 03/30/2020) – **7.8 billion**. 

 **Internet Numbers:**

  * Active internet users –  **4.54 billion**.

 **SERP Numbers** :

  * Roughly 93% of all internet traffic comes through search engines.
  * Google alone processes over 63,000 searches per second on any given day.

I don't really think that anymore needs to be said about the importance of
SERPs.

If you can [learn seo](http://serp.university), improve your serp visibility
and take your share of the traffic coming through search engines your business
growth will be, figuratively, unlimited.

Remember, it's not enough just to know what a SERP is – you need to get to the
first page of the SERPs – as 91.5% or more of people who search something
never go past the first page of results.

## How Do SERPs Work?

SERPs are continually getting more complex and comprehensive.

As Google, and other search engines, begin to _understand_ data better they
are able to organize and display this information in more ways that are
helpful to us humans.

[Google has hundreds of ranking factors](https://devinschumacher.com/google-
ranking-factors/) that determine **what** shows up on a SERP, but **how** they
are displayed will be dependent on the types of search queries being asked –
and which search engine was used.

When you input a search query into a search engine its algorithm will look
into it's enormous database of information and try to bring you back some
results that it determines will help satisfy your question – this is the SERP.
The **P** age of **S** earch Results that the **E** ngine brings back – the
Search Engine Results Page (SERP).

See how that works?

Your friends at [SERP](http://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud) Co help
businesses grow by improving their SERP visibility & positioning, in both the
paid & organic areas. Hopefully the name makes sense now!

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-15.gif)

Let's break down your traditional SERP and explain what's really going on
here.

When an individual performs a [search
query](https://devinschumacher.com/search-query/), and the algorithm returns
the results onto a page of results they are produced and displayed as 2
primary categories of SERP results: organic results (retrieved by the
algorithm) & sponsored results (paid advertisements).

### Google SERP

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/breaking-down-a-
serp-372x1024-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/03/breaking-down-a-SERP.png)

There is quite a lot going on here but what we are looking at is the Google
SERP result for the query ""treadmills"".

The query ""treadmills"" is a pretty broad and non-specific term to be
searching, so Google does not know if I want to buy one or rent one or read
about one or shop online or shop locally – so it is showing me a ton of
different results.

 **The types of results here include: **

  * informational articles and videos.
  * transactional based links, advertisements, etc.
  * local maps with stores where I can shop.
  * online stores (aka ecommerce) where I can shop.
  * reviews & articles where I can compare models to make a more informed buying decision.

But even between all of these types of results, there are really only 2
categories of them: organic & paid.

I have highlighted the ORGANIC results in GREEN, and the PAID results in RED.

As you can see, Google does a good job of differentiating the visual display
of the different types of results into ""SERP features"".

## SERP Features

A  **SERP feature**  is usually considered to be any result on a **SERP** that
is _not_ the traditional organic result.

Let's discuss some of the more common SERP features below, and save the full
list of SERP features for a separate article.

## Organic Results

A traditional organic result refers to what people are normally used to seeing
– just a simple informational, organic result showing a [page
title](https://devinschumacher.com/title-tags/) with a meta description and a
URL hyperlink.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/organic-search-
results-snippet-example-640x320-1.png)

In real life it will typically look something like this:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/organic-serp-
result-feature.png)](staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud)

SERP Features take many forms, with more coming out everyday, so we created an
article dedicated to all the different types of [serp
features](https://devinschumacher.com/serp-features/) – please comment on it
if you have discovered a SERP feature that we haven't yet included.

### Expanded Results (Site Links)

Results with site links are typically a sign of trust, or that you searched
directly for a brand name. For example when searching for the brand ""[serp
co](https://serp.co)"" we see:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2020-03-30-at-3.46.21-pm.png)

### Featured Snippet

A featured snippet is typically what people refer to when they say they rank
""position zero"". It is a summary at the top of the SERP that pulls a snippet
from an article that is typically ranking somewhere on Page 1 for the searched
term.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/featured-snippet-
serp-feature-example.png)

### Direct Answers

Direct answers are questions that Google can answer without needing to link
someone to a more thorough resource.

![direct answer SERP features](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2020-03-30-at-3.51.36-pm.png)

### People Also Ask

Google is smart enough to know that if someone asks a question, they typically
will want to know more after they get their answer. For this reason, they have
a SERP feature for questions that people also ask.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/people-also-ask-
serp-feature.png)

### Top Stories

Top stories apply to news. They are typically small cards that highlight very
recent news articles around the topic you're searching. To get here, you
pretty much need to make sure your news articles are optimized for AMP.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/top-stories-serp-
features.png)

### Knowledge Panel

The knowledge panel is one of the OG SERP Features.

It is the aggregated information on the side of the SERP that takes place when
you search something Google as understood as an ""entity"", so it can provide
additional information from various places in it's index to paint a more
complete picture of that person, place, thing, idea.

The knowledge panel will typically provide other associated information that
someone would want to understand the full picture of your search – like
organizations they were associated with, etc. In the case of our example it is
movies and personal information:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/knowledge-panel-
card.png)

Those are the most common SERP Features, but there are many, many, many more.

features/)

## Search Queries

Just like there are different types of SERP features, there are different
categories of [search queries](https://devinschumacher.com/search-queries/).

For the most part, search queries fall into 3 categories: **transactional** ,
**informational** , **navigational** (TIN) in case you needed another acronym
in your life.

  *  **Transactional  – Transactional [search queries have an intent](https://devinschumacher.com/search-intent-serp-intent/) to make an exchange of value, like trading an email address for a PDF download, or trading money for a product. 
  * **Informational**  – Informational search queries have an intent by the searcher to get more information, as the name suggests.
  *  **Navigational**  – Navigational search queries have an intent to find a specific resource, for example if someone is searching for a particular resource. Pretty much the same thing as a branded search.

These 3 primary categories of search queries can be broken down into sub-
types, and to really understand and create a solid digital marketing strategy
for your business, you need to understand them.

Read [this article on search queries](https://devinschumacher.com/search-
queries) to understand all the different types and why they are important.

The important thing to know about search queries, is the [searcher
intent](https://devinschumacher.com/search-intent/). Try to understand what
the the person is looking for and how can you provide a good resource to
satisfy this need, get ranked on Google, and get that [traffic to your
website](https://devinschumacher.com/how-websites-make-money-traffic-
monetization/) instead of your competitors.

## Search Engine Result Pages

Search engine result pages, plural?

Yes you read that right.

This is not the Lord of the Rings _internet edition_ with one SERP to rule
them all.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-17.gif)

There are multiple SERPs, so let's get into it the different **types of
SERPs**.

  * Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs)
  * Maps Engine Results Pages (MERPs?)
  * Image Engine Results Pages (IERPs?)
  * Voice Engine Results Pages (VERPs?)

Lot's of fun sounding acronyms there, but not very commonly used. If ever.

There are actually a ton of other search engines, like knowledge engines, etc.

However, without getting too crazy technical, the main takeaway here is that
traditional search engines are [keyword](https://devinschumacher.com/seo-
keywords/) based – they create an index of data query their database when
someone produces a search and return results.

But when the information searchers need is not able to be searched purely by
keywords (like when someone is looking for images, for example) the engines
need to be able do different things to return data.

The primary takeaway here is that when you are searching on Google, Google
Images, Google Maps, or YouTube the algorithms and search engines are
different. They have different rules, provide different result page
visualizations, and should not be assumed to be the same thing.

Check out this article on [search engines](https://devinschumacher.com/search-
engines/) for more in-depth information about the different types and how they
work.

## SERP Tools

There are a ton of different **SERP Tools** , many of which are actually
multi-purpose SEO Tools.

much a guarantee that you've seen & interacted with a SERP at some point in
your life.

<p>A  <strong>SERP feature</strong>  is usually considered to be any result on a <strong>SERP</strong> that
is <em>not</em> the traditional organic result.</p>
<p>Let's discuss some of the more common SERP features below, and save the full
list of SERP features for a separate article.</p>
<h2>Organic Results</h2>
<p>A traditional organic result refers to what people are normally used to seeing
– just a simple informational, organic result showing a <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/title-tags/"">page
title</a> with a meta description and a
URL hyperlink.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/organic-search-
results-snippet-example-640x320-1.png"" /></p>
<p>In real life it will typically look something like this:</p>

result-feature.png"" /></a></p>
<p>SERP Features take many forms, with more coming out everyday, so we created an
article dedicated to all the different types of <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/serp-features/"">serp
features</a> – please comment on it
if you have discovered a SERP feature that we haven't yet included.</p>
<h3>Expanded Results (Site Links)</h3>
<p>Results with site links are typically a sign of trust, or that you searched
directly for a brand name. For example when searching for the brand ""<a href=""https://serp.co"">serp
co</a>"" we see:</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2020-03-30-at-3.46.21-pm.png"" /></p>
<h3>Featured Snippet</h3>
<p>A featured snippet is typically what people refer to when they say they rank
""position zero"". It is a summary at the top of the SERP that pulls a snippet
from an article that is typically ranking somewhere on Page 1 for the searched
term.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/featured-snippet-
serp-feature-example.png"" /></p>
<h3>Direct Answers</h3>
<p>Direct answers are questions that Google can answer without needing to link
someone to a more thorough resource.</p>
<p><img alt=""direct answer SERP features"" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2020-03-30-at-3.51.36-pm.png"" /></p>
<h3>People Also Ask</h3>
<p>Google is smart enough to know that if someone asks a question, they typically
will want to know more after they get their answer. For this reason, they have
a SERP feature for questions that people also ask.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/people-also-ask-
serp-feature.png"" /></p>
<h3>Top Stories</h3>
<p>Top stories apply to news. They are typically small cards that highlight very
recent news articles around the topic you're searching. To get here, you
pretty much need to make sure your news articles are optimized for AMP.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/top-stories-serp-
features.png"" /></p>
<h3>Knowledge Panel</h3>
<p>The knowledge panel is one of the OG SERP Features.</p>
<p>It is the aggregated information on the side of the SERP that takes place when
you search something Google as understood as an ""entity"", so it can provide
additional information from various places in it's index to paint a more
complete picture of that person, place, thing, idea.</p>
<p>The knowledge panel will typically provide other associated information that
someone would want to understand the full picture of your search – like
organizations they were associated with, etc. In the case of our example it is
movies and personal information:</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/knowledge-panel-
card.png"" /></p>
<p>Those are the most common SERP Features, but there are many, many, many more.</p>

<h2>Search Queries</h2>
<p>Just like there are different types of SERP features, there are different
categories of <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/search-queries/"">search queries</a>.</p>
<p>For the most part, search queries fall into 3 categories: <strong>transactional</strong> ,
<strong>informational</strong> , <strong>navigational</strong> (TIN) in case you needed another acronym
in your life.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Transactional  – Transactional <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/search-intent-serp-intent/"">search queries have an intent</a> to make an exchange of value, like trading an email address for a PDF download, or trading money for a product. </li>
<li><strong>Informational</strong>  – Informational search queries have an intent by the searcher to get more information, as the name suggests.</li>
<li><strong>Navigational</strong>  – Navigational search queries have an intent to find a specific resource, for example if someone is searching for a particular resource. Pretty much the same thing as a branded search.</li>
</ul>
<p>These 3 primary categories of search queries can be broken down into sub-
types, and to really understand and create a solid digital marketing strategy
for your business, you need to understand them.</p>
<p>Read <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/search-
queries"">this article on search queries</a> to understand all the different types and why they are important.</p>
<p>The important thing to know about search queries, is the <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/search-intent/"">searcher
intent</a>. Try to understand what
the the person is looking for and how can you provide a good resource to
satisfy this need, get ranked on Google, and get that <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/how-websites-make-money-traffic-
monetization/"">traffic to your
website</a> instead of your competitors.</p>

<h2>Search Engine Result Pages</h2>
<p>Search engine result pages, plural?</p>
<p>Yes you read that right.</p>
<p>This is not the Lord of the Rings <em>internet edition</em> with one SERP to rule
them all.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-17.gif"" /></p>
<p>There are multiple SERPs, so let's get into it the different <strong>types of
SERPs</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs)</li>
<li>Maps Engine Results Pages (MERPs?)</li>
<li>Image Engine Results Pages (IERPs?)</li>
<li>Voice Engine Results Pages (VERPs?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Lot's of fun sounding acronyms there, but not very commonly used. If ever.</p>
<p>There are actually a ton of other search engines, like knowledge engines, etc.</p>
<p>However, without getting too crazy technical, the main takeaway here is that
traditional search engines are <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/seo-
keywords/"">keyword</a> based – they create an index of data query their database when
someone produces a search and return results.</p>
<p>But when the information searchers need is not able to be searched purely by
keywords (like when someone is looking for images, for example) the engines
need to be able do different things to return data.</p>
<p>The primary takeaway here is that when you are searching on Google, Google
Images, Google Maps, or YouTube the algorithms and search engines are
different. They have different rules, provide different result page
visualizations, and should not be assumed to be the same thing.</p>
<p>Check out this article on <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/search-
engines/"">search engines</a> for more in-depth information about the different types and how they
work.</p>
<h2>SERP Tools</h2>
<p>There are a ton of different <strong>SERP Tools</strong> , many of which are actually
multi-purpose SEO Tools.</p>
<p>We go in-depth to the best SEO tools in our article dedicated to that, which
we recommend you check out to learn more.</p>

</ol>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>SERPs are the things you see everyday, multiple times a day, that you may not
have had a name for until now. If you are reading this article it's pretty
much a guarantee that you've seen &amp; interacted with a SERP at some point in
your life.</p>
<p>SERPs will continue to evolve, change and come in different forms but the
concept will always be relevant – person needs information, person searches,
person gets a response/reply/results.</p>
<p>Learn how to position your business, products &amp; services into the various
different kinds of SERPs and all those people needing solutions will come to
you instead of your competitors.</p>"

 **Off Page SEO** (aka "" **off-site seo** "", "" **off site optimization** "" ""
**offpage optimization** "", etc.) refers to all of the actions & activities
you must perform that do NOT take place on your website.

A huge part of SEO is the off page portion - optimizing OTHER websites (along
with a variety of other activities) that give Google positive signals about
your website, and eventually translate in better website authority & better
SERP rankings for you.

It seems kind of weird that you need to go around the internet and do stuff
for other people's websites in order to make yours better, but just think of
it like digital karma (even though that is like the opposite of what it
_actually_ is).

## Why is Off-Page SEO important?

Google relies heavily on what other websites ""think"" about your website when
determining if they should trust you and display your website favorbly (rank
you high) in the SERPs. The way you manipulate, I mean IMPROVE, this is
through Off Page SEO.

 **Off-page SEO is accomplished by:**

  * Utilizing relevant content on other websites that is connected to your brand/website
  * Building relationships with other trusted & authoritative sites, and connecting them to your brand/website
  * Acquiring hyperlinks (backlinks) from other websites that point back to your website

Off Page SEO is one of the strongest things you can do to get your rankings
skyrocketing - and in this article, we cover everything you need to know.

## Off Page SEO Factors

### Backlinks

Backlinks are hyperlinks that are not located on your website, but that do
point to your website.

For example, if another website is talking about your brand and puts those
clickable words that take a user to your website, that would be a backlink.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/backlinks.png)

If the link is located on a website and goes to another page on that same
website, [like this one pointing to our
homepage](https://devinschumacher.com/home), that would be an interlink.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/internallink.png)

#### Backlink Properties

Not all backlinks are created equal. In order to maximum your SEO impact, you
need to keep these factors top of mind when acquiring backlinks:

  * Quantity
  * Authority
  * Relevance
  * Anchor Text
  * Attribute
  * Traffic

##### Quantity

Links pass trust.

The more links you have from other unique websites (aka, number of referring
domains) the more trust your website will accumulate.

There is a direct correlation between number of referring domains & how well
your website performs in search.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/referring-domains-
vs-keyword-rankings-ahrefs-content-
explorer.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/referring-domains-vs-keyword-rankings-ahrefs-content-
explorer.png)

##### Authority

Authority is sometimes called ""power"" or ""link juice"", and not all links pack
the same punch when it comes to authority.

Backlinks from websites with a higher overall domain authority (DR), and pages
with a higher page authority (UR) will push more power/authority to your
website than backlinks from weaker domains and/or weaker pages.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-pagerank-
works.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-
pagerank-works.png)

A common misconception I see all the time (seriously almost daily) in SEO is
people preaching to avoid links from websites with Low DR. This is terrible
advice.

Just because a website has a low DR doesn't mean you don't want a link from
them.

Why not? The answer is Relevance.

##### Relevance

When it comes to backlinks the term Relevance (aka ""topical relevance"", or as
we like to say ""incoming relevance"") refers to how related the asset pointing
to your website is.

If you have been following along with [SERP
University](http://serp.university) in order you have gone through the On Page
SEO sections by now, and you know that one great way to improve your SEO is to
improve the relevance of your on-page work.

Make your website as topically relevant & comprehensive for a single topic as
possible, and Google will reward you for ranking within that niche.

The same is true for relevance from your Off Page efforts.

Get links from the most relevant places, and your rankings will skyrocket.

###### How do you determine incoming relevance?

Incoming relevance can be found in the Anchor Text, Page Title, Root Domain,
and Inner URL of an asset linking to you. The more keywords you have in these
places, the more push you will get from the backlink.

Take a look at this example. We are a website about Marketing & SEO - which
backlink do you think is giving us more SEO power, based on its RELEVANCE?

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-09_at_3_11_32_pm-1024x90-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen_Shot_2019-10-09_at_3_11_32_PM.png)

Definitely #2. Why? Because we have topically relevant keywords in the
Referring Domain's: Root Domain, Page Title & Anchor Text.

##### Anchor Text

The anchor text of a link is simply that ""clickable"" part of the text that
when you click on it, it takes you off to another page.

For the user, its the clickable words.

[SERP Co](https://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud)

For a search engine, its the part below between the > < signs. I also made it
**bold** for you to see more easily:

<a href=""https://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud""> **SERP Co** </a>

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/links-1.png)

Knowing how to control & plan your links by Anchor Text is one of the most
powerful ways to outrank competitors, and should be a primary focus of yours
for off-page seo.

Read more about Anchor Text.

##### Attribute

The link ""rel"" attribute plays a huge part in the quality of a link.

""rel"", short for ""relationship"", specifics the relationship between two linked
documents.

The thing to take away from this is there are different rel attributes, and
the links you generally want are the ones with rel=""dofollow"".

This is a form of HTML that basically tells search engines ""we trust the
person we are linking to, and you should too"".

Read more about dofollow links here.

The converse of the is rel=""nofollow"", and that basically tells the search
engines the opposite.

Read more about nofollow links here.

 **Pro Tip** : Focus most of your efforts on getting DO FOLLOW links.

##### Traffic

The final property that makes links powerful (or less powerful) is the amount
(or lack) of traffic that passes through it.

Getting a link from a high authority website is awesome.

If that website gets traffic, and people are clicking through from the
Referring Domain to your website (via that hyperlink) Google sees that and it
helps provide additional trust.

You can use Ahrefs to see how much traffic a website is getting to help you
determine the quality of getting a link from that website/page.

 **Pro Tip** : If you are prospecting specific websites for links, look at
their ""Top Pages"" to see what is getting alot of traffic, and focus your
efforts on getting links there

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/traffic-to-links-
is-a-good-off-page-seo-factor-1024x542-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/traffic-to-links-is-a-good-off-page-seo-factor.png)

### Mentions

  * Unlinked mentions
  * NAP Citations

#### Unlinked Mentions

Unlinked mentions are quite literally ""mentions"" of your website or brand name
on other websites, where the creator did not actually make it a hyperlink.

Here is an example of a paragraph I pulled off a Forbes article with a bunch
of unlinked brand mentions, can you spot them all?

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/unlinked_brand_mentions_are_an_off_page_seo_factor.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/unlinked_brand_mentions_are_an_off_page_seo_factor.png)

Technically, for personal brands, all of those people could be considered
brand mentions as well.

This particular [Google patent](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-
Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-
adv.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&d=PALL&S1=08682892&OS=PN/08682892&RS=PN/08682892) talks
about unlinked mentions. In this patent, Google states:

.ugb-5f8b093 .ugb-blockquote__quote{width:70px !important;height:70px
!important}.ugb-5f8b093 .ticss-d953a032{border:3px solid #eee !important}

 _An  _ **express link** _, e.g., a hyperlink, is a link that is included in a
source resource that a user can follow to navigate to a target resource. An  _
**implied link** _  is a reference to a target resource, e.g., a citation to
the target resource, which is included in a source resource but is not an
express link to the target resource._

#### NAP Citations

NAP is an acronym for Name, Address, Phone Number.

Whenever your business's Name, Address & Phone Number appear somewhere on the
web, that is considered a ""citation"".

Clearly, there was no mention of a link here - but having your NAP appear on
various business-related web properties & directories is a great off page SEO
signal.

Read more about NAP, citation consistency, and ranking in the maps in our
Local SEO section.

### Entity

  * Directories
  * Reviews

#### Directories

Directories (aka ""business directory"", ""web directory"", etc.) is a website
with the primary purpose of listing businesses & their contact information
based on categories.

Directories are typically categorized by location or industry, but there are
also a lot of ""everything"" directories. Like the Amazon for directories, they
just list every business (example: Yelp).

Google is well aware of these popular and authoritative business directories
and it is a big trust factor (especially for Local SEO) to have your site
listed on them.

#### Reviews

Reviews are something we are probably all familiar with at this point.

Google scans popular directories and looks for reviews of your business.

Not just the stars/rating - but also the review text. Google reads the
keywords in these reviews to understand more about your business.

In this image you can see Google pulling reviews from Facebook & Foursquare
and putting them into their knowledge panel.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-09-at-4.26.41-pm.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2019-10-09-at-4.26.41-pm.png)

 **Pro Tip** : Get reviews with local & industry based keywords in them.

### Brand

  * Brand Search Volume
  * Social signals

#### Brand Search Volume

Brand search volume is an awesome (but rarely discussed) off page seo metric.

Brand search volume is quite literally the number of searches per month (on
average) that your brand name gets in Google.

If people are actually searching for your brand name - that is a huge trust
factor to Google that your business is real.

In fact, a lot of major companies get a majority of their search volume from
people looking up their brand term.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/brand-terms-help-
off-page-seo-optimization-1024x976-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/brand-terms-help-off-page-seo-optimization.png)

#### Social Signals

Social signals are the likes, follows, comments, click-throughs, that are
driven from social media.

Google says this is not a ranking factor they consider (but let's be honest,
half the sh!t they say is BS).

Personally, I do believe social signals help with legitimacy.

I also believe, however, that Google can easily tell between fake & legit
social signals (patterns & statistics is a hell of a thing).

<p><em>An  _ <strong>express link</strong> </em>, e.g., a hyperlink, is a link that is included in a
source resource that a user can follow to navigate to a target resource. An  _
<strong>implied link</strong> _  is a reference to a target resource, e.g., a citation to
the target resource, which is included in a source resource but is not an
express link to the target resource._</p>
<h4>NAP Citations</h4>
<p>NAP is an acronym for Name, Address, Phone Number.</p>
<p>Whenever your business's Name, Address &amp; Phone Number appear somewhere on the
web, that is considered a ""citation"".</p>
<p>Clearly, there was no mention of a link here - but having your NAP appear on
various business-related web properties &amp; directories is a great off page SEO
signal.</p>
<p>Read more about NAP, citation consistency, and ranking in the maps in our
Local SEO section.</p>
<h3>Entity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Directories</li>
<li>Reviews</li>
</ul>
<h4>Directories</h4>
<p>Directories (aka ""business directory"", ""web directory"", etc.) is a website
with the primary purpose of listing businesses &amp; their contact information
based on categories.</p>
<p>Directories are typically categorized by location or industry, but there are
also a lot of ""everything"" directories. Like the Amazon for directories, they
just list every business (example: Yelp).</p>
<p>Google is well aware of these popular and authoritative business directories
and it is a big trust factor (especially for Local SEO) to have your site
listed on them.</p>
<h4>Reviews</h4>
<p>Reviews are something we are probably all familiar with at this point.</p>
<p>Google scans popular directories and looks for reviews of your business.</p>
<p>Not just the stars/rating - but also the review text. Google reads the
keywords in these reviews to understand more about your business.</p>
<p>In this image you can see Google pulling reviews from Facebook &amp; Foursquare
and putting them into their knowledge panel.</p>

shot-2019-10-09-at-4.26.41-pm.png"" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong> : Get reviews with local &amp; industry based keywords in them.</p>
<h3>Brand</h3>
<ul>
<li>Brand Search Volume</li>
<li>Social signals</li>
</ul>
<h4>Brand Search Volume</h4>
<p>Brand search volume is an awesome (but rarely discussed) off page seo metric.</p>
<p>Brand search volume is quite literally the number of searches per month (on
average) that your brand name gets in Google.</p>
<p>If people are actually searching for your brand name - that is a huge trust
factor to Google that your business is real.</p>
<p>In fact, a lot of major companies get a majority of their search volume from
people looking up their brand term.</p>

off-page-seo-optimization-1024x976-1.png"" /></a></p>
<h4>Social Signals</h4>
<p>Social signals are the likes, follows, comments, click-throughs, that are
driven from social media.</p>
<p>Google says this is not a ranking factor they consider (but let's be honest,
half the sh!t they say is BS).</p>
<p>Personally, I do believe social signals help with legitimacy.</p>
<p>I also believe, however, that Google can easily tell between fake &amp; legit
social signals (patterns &amp; statistics is a hell of a thing).</p>

  * Links are one of the most important [ranking factors for SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/).
  * Getting links from other websites will help your website become more trusted, authoritative, rank higher, bring in more traffic, and make more sales. Period.

Google's OG algorithm used backlinks (links from other websites pointing to
your website) as a way to determine which sites were ""popular"" and thus,
trustworthy.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/a-definition-of-

nofollowl-link-is.png)

When a website accumulates ""PageRank"" (aka trust, authority, etc.) it ranks
more easily for keywords on the search results.

The key thing to understand about links is that they pass PageRank from one
site to another. This was how Google originally decided which websites were
trustworthy.

Understanding this concept will help you answer questions like:

  * What is a nofollow link
  * What is rel=""nofollow""
  * Why is nofollow important for SEO
  * How to check if links are nofollow
  * When to use nofollow links
  * When not to use nofollow links

...and much, much more!

So, let's get started with everything you need to know about No Follow Links.

## A Quick Intro on Link RELs

Not all links are created equal.

In fact, every hyperlink has a ""rel"" property, which is an HTML property that
tells search engines a little more information about that link.

This article focuses on the rel=""nofollow"" property, but just for you curious
folk, here are some of the other possible rel attributes:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/link-html-tag-rel-
attributes-1024x520-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/link-html-tag-rel-attributes.png)

And just recently (late 2019) Google added some NEW rel attributes:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/googles-new-link-
rel-attributes-1024x519-1.png)

## What Are Nofollow Links?

For certain links on your website, you will want to give Search Engines a
better understand about the relationship between your website and the page you
are linking to.

The way we communicate this, is through HTML tags using something called a rel
attribute. A rel attribute is a value that lives inside of an HTML anchor <a>
tag.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/what-does-a-
nofollow-link-look-like-in-
html-1024x62-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/what-does-a-nofollow-link-look-like-in-HTML.png)

It is an additional ""property"" of a hyperlink that gives more info about the
link.

In the case of the ""nofollow"" rel attribute, nofollow means that you are
telling search engines to not follow the link.

Search engines find pages and websites by ""crawling"" (the robot equivalent of
clicking) links and seeing where they end up.

But, when your link is marked as ""nofollow"" you are telling the web crawler to
not follow the link.

The converse of a nofollow link is a dofollow link. If a hyperlink is marked
as dofollow you are telling search engines to follow that link.

## Nofollow vs. Dofollow

Understanding the difference between nofollow links & dofollow links will
significantly help your SEO progress, so let's start with an example of both.

In this sentence, when we say say [click here](https://staging-
devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud), you will be taken to the the homepage of SERP
Co - from a dofollow link.

In HTML, this link would look something like this:

    
    
    <a href=""https://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud"">click here</a>

But, in this sentence, when we say [click here](https://staging-
devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud), we will still take you to the homepage of SERP
Co, but this link is marked as nofollow.

In HTML, this link would look something like this:

    
    
    <a href=""https://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud"" rel=""nofollow"">click here</a>

The key difference between nofollow links & dofollow links is that a DOFOLLOW
link will pass trust/authority to the destination, but a NOFOLLOW link will
not pass trust/authority to the link destination.

Every backlink you get pointing to your site (assuming its from a good
website, and is DOFOLLOW) is kind of like scoring a goal for your website.

If you get a backlink from another (relevant & quality) website and it is
marked as DOFOLLOW, it will help your site ranking higher for all those
awesome keywords you're going after.

Got a dofollow link? **GOAL!**

follow-link-.gif)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/getting-a-do-follow-link-.gif) Real life example of
_SEOs scoring a dofollow link_

However, if you get a backlink from another website and it is marked as
NOFOLLOW, it will NOT* help your rankings. Got a nofollow link? **No Goal.**

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/getting-a-
nofollow-link.gif)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/getting-a-nofollow-link.gif)

 _* I put an asterisk here because this is actually a highly debated topic,
and there are some merits to getting nofollow links. But for a beginner, **the
general rule is: try to get DOFOLLOW links from good websites.**_

## A Brief History of No Follow Links

SEOs love spamming (especially when it helps to increase rankings).

Believe it or not, back in the earlier days of Google Search, spamming
actually worked quite well.

So, in 2005, Google introduced the re=""nofollow"" HTML tag to combat a very
common [Black Hat SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/black-hat-seo/) technique:
comment spam.

>
> \- [Google](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/01/preventing-comment-
> spam.html)

Other Search engines soon followed suit (no pun intended), although they each
interpret the rel attribute slightly differently:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-16-at-12.58.59-pm-1024x217-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-12.58.59-PM.png)

SEOs are pretty creative, I will admit that. So, when this information started
to become prevalent us SEOs used it to our advantage, and thus was born the
concept of ""PageRank Sculpting"".

### PageRank Sculpting

Since we know that PageRank (aka trust, power, link juice, authority, etc.) is
passed via links from one page to another and that the more trust a page has
the easier it will rank, SEOs began to use this knowledge to their advantage.

> 2017](https://twitter.com/methode/status/829755916895535104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

#### PageRank Sculpting: Pre 2009

If you had 3 links on a web page, & two of the links were dofollow, but one of
the links was nofollow, then the total PageRank was split between the 2
dofollow links.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/0-how-pagerank-
sculpting-used-to-work-2-794x1024-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/0-how-pagerank-sculpting-used-to-work-2.png)

Knowing this, SEOs would find pages on their website with a lot of links, and
link from that page to another page on their website site (internal linking)
that they wanted to pass power to, and then they would nofollow the internal
links to other pages on their website they didn't want to waste sending link
juice to (link a contact page, privacy policy, etc.).

So what Google did was just count all nofollow links against your page points.

Here is an example in practice:

>  _So what happens when you have a page with “ten PageRank points” and ten
> outgoing links, and five of those links are nofollowed? […] Originally, the
> five links without nofollow would have flowed two points of PageRank each
> […] More than a year ago,  _ **Google changed how the PageRank flows so that
> the five links without nofollow would flow one point of PageRank each.** _ _
>

## Do Nofollow Links Help With SEO?

The short answer is ""No"".

  * Nofollow links are hyperlinks that tell Google not to crawl them.
  * Nofollow links are generally accepted to not pass link power.

The complex answer is Yes. Nofollow links from very high authority websites
should still be considered a win.

  *  **Links Bring Traffic:** Humans click on nofollow links, so they can still bring you traffic (which is a [ranking factor](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/)).
  *  **Natural Link Profile:** Nofollow links are a natural part of a website's link profile, so having them is a good sign in the sense that you want your backlink profile to be natural as well.
  *  **Expected Websites** : Many major websites (that Google expects you to have a presence on and links from) like Facebook, Google My Business, Yelp, Twitter, etc. are nofollow links, so having those are good.
  *  **Awareness Attracts Links** : Getting a nofollow link on a legit website does still get your website in front of real people, who might like your content and then drop you a dofollow link!
  *  **Links Can Make Sales** : Imagine get a link to your product page from a huge influencer recommending your product. Dofollow or nofollow, you're still probably going to make some sales!

We put the ""No"" in that ' The short answer is ""No"". ' part because they do
help.

Google's official stance is that ""we do not follow nofollow links"".

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-11-1.gif)

Google is a tyrant. They want to know everything about the internet.

Here's my personal stance: They absolutely DO follow nofollow links because
they want/need to know what's on the other side. If they didn't follow them
they would be giving up a piece of information and control - so no f**king
now.

But, that being said their algorithm is definitely setup in a way that they do
not pass full power for a no follow link. So, that means it's time for a pro-
tip.

 **Protip** : Make your life easier by not worrying about the exactly correct
answer to this and just focus on getting dofollow links from good websites,
not nofollow links. But, if you do get a nofollow link from a quality link,
you can still do a little celebration.

## When You Should Nofollow Outgoing Links on YOUR Website?

There are a number of times when Google actually wants you to nofollow
outgoing links on your website.

  1. Advertisements
  2. Sponsored Posts
  3. Affiliate Links
  4. Websites you don't know 100% that you trust the quality of

## How Do You Check If a Link is Nofollow?

This is quite easy. Let me show you the hard way first:

When you're on a website, simply right-click and choose ""Inspect""

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-16_at_11_09_38_pm-1024x499-1.png)

Then, you can click on an element and look down at the code. In this example
on our post about [SEO Keyword Research](https://devinschumacher.com/keyword-
research/), you will see us ""inspecting"" a link and in the screenshot, you
will see inside the HTML of the link it says rel=""nofollow""

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-16_at_11_07_06_pm-1024x604-1.png)

Thanks for suffering through that, now ill show you the easy way - a browser
plugin!

Notice how in my first screenshot you see a red border around the anchor text
""rabbit hole"" (which is our nofollow link)?

This is from a Google Chrome extension called
[NoFollow](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nofollow/dfogidghaigoomjdeacndafapdijmiid?hl=en)
\- it outlines all links on a page that are nofollow. Very handy!

## What Are Do-Follow Links?

If you have read our previous article about [nofollow
links](https://devinschumacher.com/no-follow-links/), you should understand
how REL attributes in HTML work.

Interesting point, a dofollow link actually has no rel attribute, because all
links are ""dofollow"" by **_default_**.

So, a Dofollow link is just a hyperlink that has no REL attribute specifically
telling it NOT to be a dofollow link.

## Why Are Do Follow Links Important?

Having a do-follow link on your website is basically like you saying ""Hey
Google, I trust the webpage on the other side of this link, so you should
trust them a bit too"".

 **Google kind of works like this:**

Imagine for a moment that someone you didn't know came up to you and said:
""Hey you should check out this new restaurant called Luigis, they have great
Italian food"".

Since you didn't know the person, you might not really know whether you could
trust them or not that Luigis is good.

But, what if 1,000 people you didn't know came up to you on separate occasions
and said: ""Hey you should check out this new restaurant called Luigis, they
have great Italian food"".

That might be enough 3rd party opinions for you to really trust this Luigi's
place.

So much so that you might even recommend it to someone even if you hadn't
tried it.

Google kind of works like that.

If enough websites are linking (aka ""vouching for"", or ""recommending"") to a
particular site, they will begin to trust that site.

Google's algorithm relies heavily on the ""opinion"" of other websites, and this
is why getting links from other sites pointing to your site is very important
for SEO.

## How to Check if a Link is Do-follow

When you’re on a website, simply right-click and choose “Inspect”

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-16_at_11_09_38_pm-1024x499-1-1024x499-1.png)

Then, you can click on an element and look down at the code. In this example
on our post about [SEO Keyword Research](https://devinschumacher.com/keyword-
research/), you will see us “inspecting” a link and in the screenshot, you
will see inside the HTML of the link it says rel=”nofollow”

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-16_at_11_07_06_pm-1024x604-1-1024x604-1.png)

If the link was dofollow, you would NOT see ""nofollow"" inside the link HTML.

Here is an example of one that IS dofollow:

content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-17_at_12_46_05_pm-1024x576-1.png)

Notice when we zoom in on the HTML you do NOT see any indication that the link
has been set to NOFOLLOW:

## Final Thoughts

Don't overthink this one guys & gals.

Dofollow links are links that have not been manually set to ""nofollow"".

Do follow links (from quality & relevant websites) that point to you are good
for building the SEO power of your website.","<p><strong>Do-follow links</strong> : One of the most important things you can acquire if you

In this article, we (quickly) cover what anchor text is, and then
(meticulously) cover how to use it for maximum SEO impact.

You will not want to overlook this content.

Buckle up, buttercup.

## What is anchor text?

Anchor Text is the ""clickable"" portion of a link, usually found somewhere in a
piece of content or on a webpage.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/anchor-text-
example-1.png)

You probably clicked on some anchor text to get to this article.

When we talk about anchor text we are referring to the clickable part of the
text.

 **Example 1** : [SERP Co](https://devinschumacher.com/) is a digital
marketing company.

In this first example, the anchor text would be ""SERP Co"".

 **Example 2** : [SERP Co is a digital marketing
company](https://devinschumacher.com/).

In this second example, the anchor text would be ""SERP Co is a digital
marketing company"".

From the perspective of us lovely humans, it is the part of a hyperlink that
we click on.

From the perspective of a bot, like a search engine that reads HTML (among
other things), it would look like this:

    
    
    <a href=""https://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud"">SERP Co</a>

Let's break this down real quick by looking at the full hyperlink structure in
the example above.

## Anchor text HTML

A simple hyperlink is made up of 3 parts:

  1.  **The anchor tags** : <a></a>
  2.  **The link destination** : href=""https://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud""
  3.  **The anchor text** : SERP Co

We will illustrate this example:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/1.png)

The first part of this hyperlink in HTML is the ""anchor"" tags. They look like
this:

    
    
    <a> </a>

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/2.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/2.png)

The <a> HTML tag creates the code that is used to define a hyperlink.

As we know a hyperlink connects (or ""links"") to web pages together, so the
next logical part of creating a link is to answer the question ""where will
this link take us?""

We do this by putting a URL in between the anchor tags.

The HTML to say ""let's take someone to this URL"" is denoted with:

    
    
    href=""""

We put the actual URL of the link destination in between the quotation marks.

    
    
    href=""https://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud""

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/3.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/3.png)

This href part goes inside of the anchor tags, so it ends up looking like:

    
    
    <a href=""https://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud""></a>

Now we simply need to add in what we want the clickable text to be, in this
case, ""SERP Co"" which we put in between the >< symbols.

    
    
    SERP Co

So, the whole enchilada looks like this:

    
    
    <a href=""https://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud"">SERP Co</a>

To summarize the structure of a link:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/html-anchor-
text.png)

 **Note** : There are many more attributes you can add to a hyperlink, like
telling it to ""open in a new tab"" or be ""nofollow"", but that doesn't really
matter for what we are trying to learn in this article.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/the-parts-of-a-
link.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/the-parts-
of-a-link.png)

## Why is anchor text important?

The clickable part of a link, which we now know is called ""anchor text"", gives
humans (and also search engines) more _context_ about where this link is
going.

Think about it - if you were on a website and you saw these two links, which
one would give you more information about where you would be taken to after
clicking the link:

[Click here.](https://devinschumacher.com/)

[Click here to be taken to one of the world's best digital marketing
agencies.](https://devinschumacher.com/)

Both links go to the same place, but the second link is far more descriptive.

The point is: Googlebot reads anchor text & uses it to understand & determine
what the link destination (webpage) is about, and therefore what keywords it
should rank for.

> Google employs a number of techniques to improve search quality including
> page rank,  **anchor text** , and proximity information.
>
> Source: <http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#pr>

Yes, we agree with that one.

Having relevant keywords in the anchor text of the links pointing to your page
is a very important [search engine ranking
factor](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/).

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-anchor-texts-
helps-ranking.png)

Now, in many of these examples we have been linking to another page on our
site (interlinking), which is quite easy to manipulate the anchor text because
after all, I am the one writing this blog post.

But, when there are other websites linking to you (aka you are acquiring
backlinks) then Google sees this like other ""impartial/unbiased 3rd parties""
giving their feedback/opinion on what your site is about.

For example, if we linked to our application that helps you track, manage &
improve your SEO campaigns (called SERP App) with the anchor text "" [seo
management application](https://serp.app) "", that would tell Google that link
destination very probably has something to do with being an application that
helps with SEO management.

And, since the link is coming FROM a page ABOUT SEO, it gives the link a
little more weight.

If other websites as also linking to SERP App with similar anchor texts, then
that just continues to provide more signals to Google regarding what the page
is about, and helps to increase Google’s confidence that the SERP App website
should rank for “seo management application”.

Because what is the probability that multiple unrelated websites all link to
the same page AND are using the same (or very similar) anchor text if that
page actually is not a web application to help you manage your SEO campaigns?
Unlikely.

This is what makes anchor text such a strong ranking factor.

## Anchor text types

There are many different types of anchor texts, and they all serve a purpose.

  * Branded
  * Keyword
  * Page Title
  * Sentence
  * Naked
  * Generic
  * Image
  * Variations

### Branded Anchors

Anchor text that uses your brand name or even a variation of the brand name.

We also like to include key people in branded anchors, so it could be the
owner's name, etc. After all, a ""personal brand"" is a very real thing these
days.

#### Branded Anchor Text Examples:

  * SERP Co
  * SERP Company
  * serpco
  * SERPCO
  * Devin Schumacher
  * Devin

### Keyword Anchors

Keyword anchor texts can really help propel your SEO rankings.

They can also get you into serious trouble if you overdo it, but staying safe
with these is actually not that difficult.

 **Pro tips for staying safe** :

  * Use variations of keywords, not the same one over and over again.
  * Keep all the combinations of keyword anchor text within a small/reasonable % of your overall anchor text profile (compare to other competitors in the industry for your benchmark).
  * Use the high search volume keywords more often than lower search volume keywords.

Keyword anchor texts can also be broken down into subcategories as well:

  *  **Exact match** : This would be a match to an exact keyword that your page is trying to rank for.
  *  **Partial match** : This would be a partial match to a keyword that your page is trying to rank for
  *  **Market level** : One of your target keywords with no geo modifiers (ex: seo company)
  *  **Geo modified** : One of your target keywords with geo modifiers (ex: seo company los angeles)

#### Keyword Anchor Text Examples:

  * [Digital marketing agency](https://devinschumacher.com/)
  * [SEO services](https://devinschumacher.com/)
  * [law firm marketing company](https://devinschumacher.com/services/marketing/lawyers/)
  * [seo company los angeles, ca](https://devinschumacher.com//los-angeles/)
  * etc.

### Page Title Anchors

Page title anchor text is a cool anchor text type that a lot of people don't
talk about.

It would be getting a link to your page where the anchor text is simply the
page title.

They are great because page title usually includes keywords, and are very
descriptive, but it's still very normal for someone to link to a page using
the page title.

For example, you are reading this article right now and if we were to mention
our post about [HTTP vs. HTTPS](https://devinschumacher.com/http-vs-https/)
and link to it using the page title, that wouldn't really seem all that weird,
would it?

#### Page Title Anchor Text Examples:

You will see page title anchor texts pop up frequently on those ""recommended
reading"" sections on blog posts. They look something like. this:

 **Recommended Additional Reading:**

  * [SEO Keywords: What Are Keywords for SEO & How to Choose The Good Ones](https://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud-keywords/)
  * [Digital Marketing for Dummies: Everything You Need to Know to Get Started](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=3166&action=edit)

Those would be examples of using a page title as the anchor text. Totally rad!

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-14.gif)

### Sentence Anchors

Sentence anchor texts are a nice way to keep things natural, get some keyword
variations in your anchor text and stay diversified.

Why? Simply because there is an infinite number of ways to write sentences.

#### Sentence Anchor Text Examples:

  * [This company has published studies that show how local business owners in Los Angeles can grow by generating more leads and sales using digital marketing strategies.](https://devinschumacher.com/services/marketing/los-angeles/)

### Naked Anchors

A ""naked"" anchor text refers to the use of just the URL as the anchor text.

Naked anchor texts are very natural links for websites to get.

And, if you have done your URL structure right they will include keywords
within them. **_Muy Bien for SEO._**

Muy Bien??

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOpjYE-iPnY

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-18-at-2.51.26-pm.png)

There are a lot of ways to write a URL, and since most websites are now set up
to redirect all variations to one primary URL protocol, there are a lot of
different naked URL variations you can get.

#### Naked Anchor Text Examples:

  * [staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud](https://devinschumacher.com/)
  * [www.staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud](https://devinschumacher.com/)
  * <http://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud>
  * <http://www.staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud>
  * <https://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud>
  * <https://www.staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud>

and...

  * [staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/](https://devinschumacher.com/)
  * [www.staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/](https://devinschumacher.com/)
  * <https://devinschumacher.com/>
  * <http://www.staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/>
  * <https://devinschumacher.com/>
  * <https://www.staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/>

 **Pro tip** : Utilize all these different types of naked URL variations. It's
a great way to keep your anchor profile text varied so it doesn't look like
you are trying to cheat the system).

### Generic Anchors

Generic (aka ""misc"", ""miscellaneous"", or ""random"") anchors are just random
words that people use when linking somewhere.

#### Generic Anchor Text Examples:

  * [click here](https://devinschumacher.com/)
  * [here](https://devinschumacher.com/)
  * [found here](https://devinschumacher.com/)
  * [this article](https://devinschumacher.com/carpet-cleaning-marketing-ideas/)
  * [super cool](http://instagram.com/dvnschmchr)
  * etc.

### Image Anchor Text

Whenever an image links out somewhere, Google will automatically use the image
alt-text as the link's anchor text.

Since most people don't fill this out, you will get a ""blank"" anchor text,
that looks like this: **< a>no text</a>**

### Variations

This is not an actually definable anchor text type but I wanted to include it
because variations of your anchor texts (and anchor text types) are how you
keep things natural, strategic and diversified.

Here are some common anchor text variations (with examples) that we like to
use:

  *  **Brand + Keyword** : [SERP Co - Digital Marketing](https://devinschumacher.com/)
  *  **Generic + Keyword** : [click here to visit this marketing agency](https://devinschumacher.com/)
  *  **Naked + Keyword** : [https://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud - an online marketing firm](https://devinschumacher.com/)

## Anchor text profile

Your anchor text profile (aka anchor text ratio) is quite literally the entire
make-up of all the anchor texts of all the backlinks pointing to your page.

For example, if our website SERP Co had 4 links pointing to it with these
anchor texts:

  * staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud
  * SERP Co
  * click here
  * digital marketing company

Then our anchor text ratio (aka profile) would be:

  * 25%: Naked anchor text
  * 25%: Branded anchor text
  * 25%: Generic anchor text
  * 25%: Keyword anchor text

This is obviously a very simple example, but the point is that you want your
anchor text profile to be natural.

Our actual anchor text profile, at the time of writing this, looks more like
this:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/anchor_text_profile_for_serp_co-1024x740-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/anchor_text_profile_for_SERP_Co.png)

To be honest, our anchor text profile is quite shit right now - but we just
barely started building links and we purchased a couple of smaller SEO
companies that ended up getting 301'd into our domain, so I'm not surprised
that it's kind of weird.

Your focus should be to make sure you never have an anchor text ratio with a
distribution that looks manipulated and will potentially be getting the
attention of Google's algorithm.

If all of your anchor texts are keyword-based, it is pretty obvious for the
algorithm to know that you are manipulating your anchor text to try and rank
your website higher - because it is not normal for a website to receive all
keyword anchor texts.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/anchor-text-
distribution-infographic.png)

## How to evaluate your anchor text profile

Whenever you are trying to evaluate pretty much anything in SEO it's usually a
good idea to start with a relevant benchmark.

What does this mean in practice?

Find & analyze the competition who is winning where you want to be winning.

 **Step 1: Make a list of your hyper-relevant competitors**

  * Competitor1.com
  * Competitor2.com
  * Competitor3.com

 **Step 2: Add your website to ""Ahrefs > Anchors"" & Export to CSV**

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-18_at_8_08_31_pm-1024x536-1.png)

 **Step 3: Repeat Step 2 for each of your competitors**

 **Step 4: Open the CSV and categorize the anchor text types**

 **Pro tip** : Instead of using a spreadsheet for this, use SERP App for this.
Everytime you get new links you can add an anchor text type to it and the
software will begin to keep track of everything and give you recommendations.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/categorizing-
anchor-text-types-1-1024x845-1.png)

 **Step 5: Create a simple pie chart, and voila!**

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-18-at-8.32.19-pm-1024x470-1.png)

If you do this for each of the top competitors who are ranking for a keyword
you want (and ideally you would do this with a page on your website, not your
entire domain like I did in the example) you will quickly see the anchor text
ratios of the top guys, and use it as a benchmark for your anchor text
profile.

## Anchor text best practices

 **Warning** : Improperly using anchor text can get you into serious trouble.

 **Un-warning** : Follow what we tell you and you'll be just fine kiddo. And
if you have questions or want an expert opinion before you do something to
your site, you can always ask us [in the SERP University
group](http://serp.university).

### Quick history lesson

Originally rolling out in 2012, and now part of the core Google algorithm, the
""Penguin Algorithm Update"" was an update by Google to improve the quality of
their search results and try to eliminate spammers.

Specifically, the Penguin algorithm targeted ""link schemes"" and any websites
that seemed to be intentionally manipulating aspects of backlinks to improve
their search engine rankings.

Manipulating your anchor text definitely falls into the category of Penguin,
but can also fall into the Panda algorithm as well.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/anchor-text-
penalty-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/anchor-
text-penalty-1.png)

If you don't know what that is don't worry about it right now. The point is -
always use anchor text best practices to avoid peril.

So anyway, now that the boring history lesson part of the show is done, let's
kick off these best practices with a screenshot from Google about anchor text
best practices.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/googles-best-
practices-on-anchor-text.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/googles-best-practices-on-anchor-text.png)

Now, I think we know by now that half of what Google says publicly is total BS
and we need to take it with a grain of salt. We prefer to go by our personal
tests to see what's working - not what some Google monkey has been told to
tell us.

Some things Google says we will confirm, some we vehemently oppose.

As our good friend the Dalai Lama once said: “Know the rules well, so you can
break them effectively.”

### Anchor text best-practice summary from our own research

  * Keep your anchor text profile natural.
  * Try to save your keyword anchor texts for your most powerful links.
  * Don't over-optimize your anchor text (this isn't natural).
  * Don't build links with the same anchor text consecutively (this isn't natural).
  * Look to other websites in your industry and see how your anchor text profile matches up to theirs.
  * Get the surrounding words/sentences before and after your anchor text to be hyper-relevant to the topic so a little extra push (this is called co-occurrence).
  * If you want to stay as safe as possible use more naked URL & generic anchors.
  * Use keyword anchors last in your link building arsenal - many times you can rank without them.
  * Remember that the anchor text of internal links should be taken into account when thinking about a specific page's anchor text profile.

In general, we like to our most powerful links (links from high DR & UR sites)
to have the closest to the exact match keyword anchor text as possible.

Use your less powerful links to help diversify your anchor text, and use your
more powerful links for keyword anchor texts.

## What do I do if I have an over-optimized anchor text profile?

This is actually pretty easy to deal with.

If you think you're rankings are suffering or you are potentially setting
yourself up for a nice big Google slap, you can quite easily ""de-optimize""
(otherwise known as ""dilute"") your anchor text.

And in case you were wondering, we have located actual footage of a Google
slap in action on someone who over-optimized their anchor text:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/download-18.gif)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/download-18.gif)

Definitely something you want to avoid at all costs.

So, how do you do it? How do you dilute your anchor text?

  *  **Build more links** : The easiest way is to build more links! Make sure to build links with the ""safe"" types of anchors - naked, branded, generic.
  *  **Disavow** : If you have a ton of links AND they are low quality, then it will probably be easier to just disavow them.

Here are some great link types you can build to dilute your pages anchor text:

  * Socials
  * Directories
  * Press Releases
  * Blog comments
  * Forum comments
  * etc.

Now, a lot of these are nofollow - so if you are trying to dilute your
dofollow anchor text then you need to be a bit more creative. But I think you
get the overall concept.

Once again, if you need help with this you are welcome to ask your questions

Group](https://serp.university).

<h2>What is anchor text?</h2>
<p>Anchor Text is the ""clickable"" portion of a link, usually found somewhere in a
piece of content or on a webpage.</p>

<p>You probably clicked on some anchor text to get to this article.</p>
<p>When we talk about anchor text we are referring to the clickable part of the
text.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong> : <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/"">SERP Co</a> is a digital

<p>In this first example, the anchor text would be ""SERP Co"".</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong> : <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/"">SERP Co is a digital marketing
company</a>.</p>
<p>In this second example, the anchor text would be ""SERP Co is a digital
marketing company"".</p>
<p>From the perspective of us lovely humans, it is the part of a hyperlink that
we click on.</p>
<p>From the perspective of a bot, like a search engine that reads HTML (among
other things), it would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href=""https://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud""&gt;SERP Co&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Let's break this down real quick by looking at the full hyperlink structure in

<p>Yes, we agree with that one.</p>
<p>Having relevant keywords in the anchor text of the links pointing to your page
is a very important <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/"">search engine ranking
factor</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-anchor-texts-

destination very probably has something to do with being an application that
helps with SEO management.</p>
<p>And, since the link is coming FROM a page ABOUT SEO, it gives the link a
little more weight.</p>
<p>If other websites as also linking to SERP App with similar anchor texts, then
that just continues to provide more signals to Google regarding what the page
is about, and helps to increase Google’s confidence that the SERP App website
should rank for “seo management application”.</p>
<p>Because what is the probability that multiple unrelated websites all link to
the same page AND are using the same (or very similar) anchor text if that
page actually is not a web application to help you manage your SEO campaigns?
Unlikely.</p>
<p>This is what makes anchor text such a strong ranking factor.</p>
<h2>Anchor text types</h2>
<p>There are many different types of anchor texts, and they all serve a purpose.</p>
<ul>
<li>Branded</li>
<li>Keyword</li>
<li>Page Title</li>
<li>Sentence</li>
<li>Naked</li>
<li>Generic</li>
<li>Image</li>
<li>Variations</li>
</ul>
<h3>Branded Anchors</h3>
<p>Anchor text that uses your brand name or even a variation of the brand name.</p>
<p>We also like to include key people in branded anchors, so it could be the
owner's name, etc. After all, a ""personal brand"" is a very real thing these
days.</p>
<h4>Branded Anchor Text Examples:</h4>
<ul>
<li>SERP Co</li>
<li>SERP Company</li>
<li>serpco</li>
<li>SERPCO</li>
<li>Devin Schumacher</li>
<li>Devin</li>
</ul>
<h3>Keyword Anchors</h3>
<p>Keyword anchor texts can really help propel your SEO rankings.</p>
<p>They can also get you into serious trouble if you overdo it, but staying safe
with these is actually not that difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tips for staying safe</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li>Use variations of keywords, not the same one over and over again.</li>
<li>Keep all the combinations of keyword anchor text within a small/reasonable % of your overall anchor text profile (compare to other competitors in the industry for your benchmark).</li>
<li>Use the high search volume keywords more often than lower search volume keywords.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keyword anchor texts can also be broken down into subcategories as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exact match</strong> : This would be a match to an exact keyword that your page is trying to rank for.</li>
<li><strong>Partial match</strong> : This would be a partial match to a keyword that your page is trying to rank for</li>
<li><strong>Market level</strong> : One of your target keywords with no geo modifiers (ex: seo company)</li>
<li><strong>Geo modified</strong> : One of your target keywords with geo modifiers (ex: seo company los angeles)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Keyword Anchor Text Examples:</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/"">Digital marketing agency</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/"">SEO services</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/services/marketing/lawyers/"">law firm marketing company</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com//los-angeles/"">seo company los angeles, ca</a></li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Page Title Anchors</h3>
<p>Page title anchor text is a cool anchor text type that a lot of people don't
talk about.</p>
<p>It would be getting a link to your page where the anchor text is simply the
page title.</p>
<p>They are great because page title usually includes keywords, and are very
descriptive, but it's still very normal for someone to link to a page using
the page title.</p>
<p>For example, you are reading this article right now and if we were to mention
our post about <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/http-vs-https/"">HTTP vs. HTTPS</a>
and link to it using the page title, that wouldn't really seem all that weird,
would it?</p>
<h4>Page Title Anchor Text Examples:</h4>
<p>You will see page title anchor texts pop up frequently on those ""recommended
reading"" sections on blog posts. They look something like. this:</p>

</ul>
<p>Those would be examples of using a page title as the anchor text. Totally rad!</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-14.gif"" /></p>
<h3>Sentence Anchors</h3>
<p>Sentence anchor texts are a nice way to keep things natural, get some keyword
variations in your anchor text and stay diversified.</p>
<p>Why? Simply because there is an infinite number of ways to write sentences.</p>
<h4>Sentence Anchor Text Examples:</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/services/marketing/los-angeles/"">This company has published studies that show how local business owners in Los Angeles can grow by generating more leads and sales using digital marketing strategies.</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Naked Anchors</h3>
<p>A ""naked"" anchor text refers to the use of just the URL as the anchor text.</p>
<p>Naked anchor texts are very natural links for websites to get.</p>
<p>And, if you have done your URL structure right they will include keywords
within them. <strong><em>Muy Bien for SEO.</em></strong></p>
<p>Muy Bien??</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOpjYE-iPnY</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-18-at-2.51.26-pm.png"" /></p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to write a URL, and since most websites are now set up
to redirect all variations to one primary URL protocol, there are a lot of
different naked URL variations you can get.</p>
<h4>Naked Anchor Text Examples:</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/"">staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud</a></li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong> : Utilize all these different types of naked URL variations. It's
a great way to keep your anchor profile text varied so it doesn't look like
you are trying to cheat the system).</p>
<h3>Generic Anchors</h3>
<p>Generic (aka ""misc"", ""miscellaneous"", or ""random"") anchors are just random
words that people use when linking somewhere.</p>
<h4>Generic Anchor Text Examples:</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/"">click here</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/"">here</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/"">found here</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/carpet-cleaning-marketing-ideas/"">this article</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://instagram.com/dvnschmchr"">super cool</a></li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Image Anchor Text</h3>
<p>Whenever an image links out somewhere, Google will automatically use the image
alt-text as the link's anchor text.</p>
<p>Since most people don't fill this out, you will get a ""blank"" anchor text,
that looks like this: <strong>&lt; a&gt;no text</a></strong></p>
<h3>Variations</h3>
<p>This is not an actually definable anchor text type but I wanted to include it
because variations of your anchor texts (and anchor text types) are how you
keep things natural, strategic and diversified.</p>
<p>Here are some common anchor text variations (with examples) that we like to
use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brand + Keyword</strong> : <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/"">SERP Co - Digital Marketing</a></li>
<li><strong>Generic + Keyword</strong> : <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/"">click here to visit this marketing agency</a></li>
<li><strong>Naked + Keyword</strong> : <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/"">https://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud - an online marketing firm</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Anchor text profile</h2>
<p>Your anchor text profile (aka anchor text ratio) is quite literally the entire
make-up of all the anchor texts of all the backlinks pointing to your page.</p>
<p>For example, if our website SERP Co had 4 links pointing to it with these
anchor texts:</p>
<ul>
<li>staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud</li>
<li>SERP Co</li>
<li>click here</li>
<li>digital marketing company</li>
</ul>
<p>Then our anchor text ratio (aka profile) would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>25%: Naked anchor text</li>
<li>25%: Branded anchor text</li>
<li>25%: Generic anchor text</li>
<li>25%: Keyword anchor text</li>
</ul>
<p>This is obviously a very simple example, but the point is that you want your
anchor text profile to be natural.</p>
<p>Our actual anchor text profile, at the time of writing this, looks more like
this:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/anchor_text_profile_for_SERP_Co.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/anchor_text_profile_for_serp_co-1024x740-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>To be honest, our anchor text profile is quite shit right now - but we just
barely started building links and we purchased a couple of smaller SEO
companies that ended up getting 301'd into our domain, so I'm not surprised
that it's kind of weird.</p>
<p>Your focus should be to make sure you never have an anchor text ratio with a
distribution that looks manipulated and will potentially be getting the
attention of Google's algorithm.</p>
<p>If all of your anchor texts are keyword-based, it is pretty obvious for the
algorithm to know that you are manipulating your anchor text to try and rank
your website higher - because it is not normal for a website to receive all
keyword anchor texts.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/anchor-text-
distribution-infographic.png"" /></p>
<h2>How to evaluate your anchor text profile</h2>
<p>Whenever you are trying to evaluate pretty much anything in SEO it's usually a
good idea to start with a relevant benchmark.</p>
<p>What does this mean in practice?</p>
<p>Find &amp; analyze the competition who is winning where you want to be winning.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Make a list of your hyper-relevant competitors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Competitor1.com</li>
<li>Competitor2.com</li>
<li>Competitor3.com</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add your website to ""Ahrefs &gt; Anchors"" &amp; Export to CSV</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-18_at_8_08_31_pm-1024x536-1.png"" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Repeat Step 2 for each of your competitors</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Open the CSV and categorize the anchor text types</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong> : Instead of using a spreadsheet for this, use SERP App for this.
Everytime you get new links you can add an anchor text type to it and the
software will begin to keep track of everything and give you recommendations.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/categorizing-
anchor-text-types-1-1024x845-1.png"" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Create a simple pie chart, and voila!</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-18-at-8.32.19-pm-1024x470-1.png"" /></p>
<p>If you do this for each of the top competitors who are ranking for a keyword
you want (and ideally you would do this with a page on your website, not your
entire domain like I did in the example) you will quickly see the anchor text
ratios of the top guys, and use it as a benchmark for your anchor text
profile.</p>
<h2>Anchor text best practices</h2>
<p><strong>Warning</strong> : Improperly using anchor text can get you into serious trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Un-warning</strong> : Follow what we tell you and you'll be just fine kiddo. And
if you have questions or want an expert opinion before you do something to
your site, you can always ask us <a href=""http://serp.university"">in the SERP University
group</a>.</p>
<h3>Quick history lesson</h3>
<p>Originally rolling out in 2012, and now part of the core Google algorithm, the
""Penguin Algorithm Update"" was an update by Google to improve the quality of
their search results and try to eliminate spammers.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Penguin algorithm targeted ""link schemes"" and any websites
that seemed to be intentionally manipulating aspects of backlinks to improve
their search engine rankings.</p>
<p>Manipulating your anchor text definitely falls into the category of Penguin,
but can also fall into the Panda algorithm as well.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/anchor-
text-penalty-1.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/anchor-text-
penalty-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>If you don't know what that is don't worry about it right now. The point is -
always use anchor text best practices to avoid peril.</p>
<p>So anyway, now that the boring history lesson part of the show is done, let's
kick off these best practices with a screenshot from Google about anchor text
best practices.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/googles-best-practices-on-anchor-text.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/googles-best-
practices-on-anchor-text.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Now, I think we know by now that half of what Google says publicly is total BS
and we need to take it with a grain of salt. We prefer to go by our personal
tests to see what's working - not what some Google monkey has been told to
tell us.</p>
<p>Some things Google says we will confirm, some we vehemently oppose.</p>
<p>As our good friend the Dalai Lama once said: “Know the rules well, so you can
break them effectively.”</p>

<h3>Anchor text best-practice summary from our own research</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keep your anchor text profile natural.</li>
<li>Try to save your keyword anchor texts for your most powerful links.</li>
<li>Don't over-optimize your anchor text (this isn't natural).</li>
<li>Don't build links with the same anchor text consecutively (this isn't natural).</li>
<li>Look to other websites in your industry and see how your anchor text profile matches up to theirs.</li>
<li>Get the surrounding words/sentences before and after your anchor text to be hyper-relevant to the topic so a little extra push (this is called co-occurrence).</li>
<li>If you want to stay as safe as possible use more naked URL &amp; generic anchors.</li>
<li>Use keyword anchors last in your link building arsenal - many times you can rank without them.</li>
<li>Remember that the anchor text of internal links should be taken into account when thinking about a specific page's anchor text profile.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, we like to our most powerful links (links from high DR &amp; UR sites)
to have the closest to the exact match keyword anchor text as possible.</p>
<p>Use your less powerful links to help diversify your anchor text, and use your
more powerful links for keyword anchor texts.</p>
<h2>What do I do if I have an over-optimized anchor text profile?</h2>
<p>This is actually pretty easy to deal with.</p>
<p>If you think you're rankings are suffering or you are potentially setting
yourself up for a nice big Google slap, you can quite easily ""de-optimize""
(otherwise known as ""dilute"") your anchor text.</p>
<p>And in case you were wondering, we have located actual footage of a Google
slap in action on someone who over-optimized their anchor text:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/download-18.gif""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/download-18.gif"" /></a></p>
<p>Definitely something you want to avoid at all costs.</p>
<p>So, how do you do it? How do you dilute your anchor text?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build more links</strong> : The easiest way is to build more links! Make sure to build links with the ""safe"" types of anchors - naked, branded, generic.</li>
<li><strong>Disavow</strong> : If you have a ton of links AND they are low quality, then it will probably be easier to just disavow them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some great link types you can build to dilute your pages anchor text:</p>
<ul>
<li>Socials</li>
<li>Directories</li>
<li>Press Releases</li>
<li>Blog comments</li>
<li>Forum comments</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, a lot of these are nofollow - so if you are trying to dilute your
dofollow anchor text then you need to be a bit more creative. But I think you
get the overall concept.</p>

Really wish I could have gotten that to rhyme.

Link building is one of the top 3, _if not the top_ , [Google ranking
factor](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/) that you need to
master, systemize, and deploy consistently if you want your website to
dominate search engines.

To master link building you must be well versed in content strategy, content
creation, prospecting, domain quality evaluation, email, outreach, email
outreach, conversation, negotiation, and resilience.

This article will cover high-level concepts about link building, while
dropping some never before heard nuggets of gold, with the goal of getting you
fully acclimated to understanding the 30,000-foot view of how link building
works, why it's important, and how to implement it into your agency, business,
or SEO strategy.

This topic is a beast, so before we get into it - let's kick off with a joke
to keep the mood fun:

## What is Link Building?

 **Link Building Definition:** Link building (aka ""link-building"",
""linkbuilding"", or ""backlinking"") is the process of getting other websites to
hyperlink to your website, with the goal of improving the search engine
rankings of your site.

Links are the primary method of navigation on the internet. They direct humans
(and search engine crawlers) from one web page to another.

Humans (and search engines) inherently associate links as a signal of
authority and trust. For example, if Forbes.com writes an article that has a
link to your website it is generally perceived as a recommendation to go and
check out your business.

Both humans and search engines consider a link like a ""referral"" or
""recommendation"" or ""vote of confidence"" from one site to another.

Getting links to your website is valuable for acquiring new traffic, audience
building, developing relationships, and obviously SEO.

When other authoritative, trusted, and relevant (to your business) websites
link to your website some of their ""power"" is transferred to your website.
This is called ""getting a backlink"".

The more websites that you can get to link to your website (assuming once
again that they themselves are relevant and trusted) the more power your
website will accumulate.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/link-building-
illustration.jpg)

## Why is Link Building so important?

The original Google algorithm was based primarily on evaluating websites based
on how many backlinks a website had from other sites on the internet.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/googles-original-
algorithm-was-based-on-getting-backlinks.png)

Even though that was all the way back in 1998 and the algorithm has evolved a
lot since then, having other websites link to you is still one of the top SEO
ranking factors - by far.

The only difference is that today there are a lot more factors which us SEOs
need to understand when acquiring links.

You don't want a link from anyone. You need to be strategic and selective
about who you get links from, and this is the art & science of link building.

  * Link building (done right) improves your domain's authority, power & trust.
  * Link building is a great way to get traffic from other websites to come to your website.

Just to drive this point home, here is what happens when you publish content
on your website and then start link building.

months into our SEO campaign at the time of this screenshot.

## Link Building Fundamentals

A link (aka hyperlink) is the connection between one webpage and another
webpage.

## Some basic properties of backlinks

## Internal vs. External

  * A link can be an external link, which sends you to some other website. For example, the link in this sentence which sends you to [SERP App, our SEO management tool](http://serp.app).

  * A link can also be an internal link, which sends you to a different webpage on the same website, like [this link which sends you to our homepage.](https://devinschumacher.com/)

## Anchor Text

  * The clickable part of a link is called [anchor text](https://devinschumacher.com/anchor-text/), and it gives people (and search engines) a bit of context/information about where they are about to go if they click the link.

## Dofollow vs. Nofollow

  * A link can be [dofollow](https://devinschumacher.com/do-follow-links/), which means that search engines will crawl the link and transfer power from one website to another. These are the links you normally want to get if possible.

  * A link can be [nofollow](https://devinschumacher.com/no-follow-links/), which means that search engines won't crawl the link and you will not get any power coming to your website. If you can get a nofollow link from a very relevant website it is still good to acquire, but it will not help you out nearly as much as a dofollow link.

## Built vs. Earned

  * A link can be a ""built link"" which means that you can personally go out and build it whenever you link. An example of this would be posting a tweet with a link to your newest blog article or created a Facebook business page that has a link to your business website in the profile area.

  * A link can also be an ""earned link"" which means that you acquired a link that you cannot build at your own will. An example of this would be another website you don't have editor access to (like Forbes, New York Times, or even a small blogger in your niche) that puts a link to your website somewhere in their content.

## Natural vs. Outreached

  * A link is considered a ""natural link"" (or natural earned link) if another website links to your website and you never even had to ask. Maybe they just came across your content on their own, liked what they saw, and decided to add a link to your website. Happens all the time.

  * A link can also be acquired by using ""outreach"". This means you find a website you want a link from, contact the author of the post or the owner of the website, and ask them to include a link to your website. 

## Link Building Campaigns

Now that you know the fundamentals of link building, and why it is important
to build links it's time to talk about how to create a link building campaign
that will grow the organic traffic to your website.

Link building campaigns can be very complex, so it is our goal to give you all
the tools you need to simplify it & succeed.

You will want to have 2 primary types of link building campaigns:

  * A campaign to acquire ""built links""
  * A campaign to acquire ""earned links""

## Built Links Campaign

This is really less of a ""campaign"" by the definition of the word and more of
just a process you want to follow.

A campaign is defined as ""work in an organized and active way toward a
particular goal, typically a political or social one.""

Colloquially when we talk about a link building campaign we are normally
referring to outreach & earned links.

But, this should really be done after the foundational stuff has been started
so let's go through the basics of ""built links"".

But essentially you want to start by:

  * Create all the normal social profiles for your business
  * Claim your business on various business directories
  * Engage in conversations with people online (forums, blog post comments, social communities, etc.)
  * Schedule a press release for something newsworthy

We cover this in much more depth in our guide about building backlinks.

Let's keep this train of thought on earned links.

## Link Building Campaign Overview

  * Goals
  * A quality website
  * A face of the website (the human element)
  * Quality content 
  * A Repeatable Process (aka ""system"" or ""SOP"")
  * Link building tools
  * Begin!

## Goals

What result are you trying to achieve, and how do you plan to measure it?

Every link building campaign needs goals & KPIs (key performance indicators).

  * A goal is an overall broad ambition or effort - the desired end result.
  * A KPI is a quantifiable measurement used to evaluate the level of success of your campaign.

You can have 1 or many goals, and 1 or many KPIs but at least have 1.

 **Examples of Link Building Campaign goals:**

  * Acquire 10 new unique backlinks
  * Improve the DR of my website by 5 points
  * Rank for a certain keyword

 **Establish your goal(s), and move forward.**

## A quality website

No one is going to link to you if your website is trash.

Well, I shouldn't say no one because people link to trash websites all the
time - but it will be much harder for you to acquire links if your website
looks bad, untrustworthy, or just downright stupid. Unless your website is
Lings Cars:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-does-lings-
cars-get-links-1024x666-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/how-does-lings-cars-get-
links.png)[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-19-at-2.15.04-pm-1024x166-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-19-at-2.15.04-PM.png)look at all
those links!

But Lings Cars is an outlier - an exception to the rule. Never create a
strategy around the outliers.

## A human element

Having a ""face of the website"" is not required, but it is definitely helpful.

People relate to people - not inanimate objections.

If someone can go to your website, see a picture of your, understand who you
are, etc. it will make your job of building relationships (and subsequently
building links) much easier.

## Quality Content

Quality content (aka ""link-able assets"") is a piece of content on your website
that people get value from.

In ""SEO speak"", quality content means that you have some kind of asset that
another website owner would feel good about linking to.

**Example of quality content:**

  * A well-written blog post
  * An expert guide
  * An awesome infographic
  * An interactive tool (like a mortgage calculator)
  * An original piece of research
  * etc.

 **Why does it matter?**

Other website owners are trying to cultivate trust with their audience and
many times that means having to send their hard-earned visitors somewhere else
to get additional information on a topic.

For example, a social media marketing expert who mentions SEO in her blog
post. Maybe her readers don't really know what SEO is (after all they are
there for social media marketing, which is a different discipline).

She might want to link out to an authority on the subject of SEO so her
readers can get a bit more understanding on the topic - without having to
spend her time writing a bunch of content on SEO - which she may or may not
even be an expert on herself.

Before you can start earning links to your website you need awesome content
that someone would want to link to in the first place.

 **Identify (or create) quality content on your website.** /cal

#### A Repeatable Process

A successful link building campaign needs to have a standard operating
procedure (SOP).

An SOP allows you (or your team) to carry out complex operations at a high
level of performance, reduce errors and consistently achieve the same awesome
result.

> Document everything you have to repeatedly do and turn it into a step-by-
> step process that can be followed by anyone on your team.

> [Tweet](/)

## Link Building Tools

And finally, you will need some tools.

I am not talking about software that automatically builds links for you.

I am talking about tools like:

  * A place to keep track of prospects (ex: Google Drive or Excel)
  * A website evaluation tool (ex: Ahrefs or SEM Rush)
  * Contact information finders (ex: Hunter.io)
  * Email Schedulers (ex: [Mailshake](https://devinschumacher.com/review/mailshake/) or GMASS)
  * A CRM (ex: Streak)
  * A place to track your successful links (ex: [SERP App](http://serp.app))

Having the correct tools for the job will allow you to increase your output &
success by 10x, 100x, or even 1000x compared to doing everything manually.

## What Makes a Good Link?

The key to a successful prospecting phase is to find quality websites.

What makes a website prospect a quality one?

Our team uses an easy to remember acronym when evaluating the quality of a
potential backlink prospect: ART.

  *  **A** : Authority
  *  **R** : Relevance
  *  **T** : Trust or Traffic

Evaluating the quality of a. link will be based on these three ART factors -
but keep in mind that you want to be evaluating the A,R,T of not only the
website as a whole but also the specific page where you want to get a link
from (domain-level factors vs. page-level factors).

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/backlink-factors-
on-page-factors-ahrefs-metrics.jpg)

## Authority

## Authority of the page

The ""authority"" or ""strength"" of a certain webpage comes from the
quantity/quality of backlinks (and interlinks from other authoritative pages)
it has.

Remember that hyperlinks ""pass link power"" to their destination, so if you get
a link from a webpage that has a bunch of links pointing to it you are getting
more power passed directly to your page.

For example, if I was running a link building campaign to improve the rankings
of my [Keyword Research](https://devinschumacher.com/keyword-research/)
article, I would rather have a link from Ahrefs.com on this page with 692
referring domains:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-19_at_3_36_01_pm.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-19_at_3_36_01_pm.png)

Then this page with 1:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/1-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/1-1.png)

You can easily check the authority of a website by looking at the ""UR"" in
Ahrefs. Be sure to enter the entire URL into site explorer so you get the
stats on. the specific page:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-21_at_12_18_20_pm-1024x247-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen_Shot_2019-10-21_at_12_18_20_PM.png)

 **Try to get links from web pages that have a lot of links themselves.**

## Authority of the domain

The ""authority"" or ""strength"" of an entire website comes from the
quantity/quality of backlinks the whole website has coming to all of its
pages.

In general, getting a link from a very strong website, like Forbes, would be
much more ""powerful"" than a link from some unknown blog.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/authority-links-
carry-more-weight-illustration.jpg)

You can easily check the authority of a website by looking at the DR in
Ahrefs:

## Relevance

## Domain-level Relevance

  *  **Keywords in Domain** : Getting a link from a website with relevant keywords in the domain adds relevance.

## Page-level Relevance

  *  **Keywords in URL** : Getting a link from a website with relevant keywords in the page URL adds relevance.
  *  **Keywords in Page Title** : Getting a link from a website with relevant keywords in the Page Title adds relevance.

## Link-level Relevance

  *  **Anchor text** : The clickable portion of the link adds relevance. Keywords in anchor text add relevance, but you need to be careful with this. 

Please read our guide on [anchor text](https://devinschumacher.com/anchor-
text/) before trying to decide what anchor text to make your backlinks.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/anchor-
links.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/anchor-
links.png)

  *  **Co-occurrence** : The text surrounding the link provides context and can add relevance.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/surrounding-text-
link-anchor-illustration.jpg)

  *  **Link position** : Where the link appears on the page adds relevance.

## A Sample of Link Building in Action

The first step of your link building campaign will be to identify a list of
prospects.

This means creating a spreadsheet of URLs that you would want links from -
other websites in your industry that have already built up some authority.

We've covered all the basics now.

Now, let's talk about how this looks in practice.

  * Find Competitors & Prospects
  * Find contact information
  * Contact
  * Get a link

## Find competitors & prospects

## Competitors

Prospects are other websites that would be most likely to link to your
content. To find them, we must first find your competitors. Super easy to do.

The obvious websites that make good prospects are websites that have _already
linked to similar content as yours_.

Simply go to Ahrefs > Keywords Explorer and pop in the KEYWORD that you are
trying to rank for.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-21_at_12_39_23_pm-1024x508-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen_Shot_2019-10-21_at_12_39_23_PM.png)

Scroll down to ""SERP Overview"", expand the results to 100, and export the
list:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-21_at_12_42_12_pm-1024x453-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen_Shot_2019-10-21_at_12_42_12_PM.png)

Now you have a list of all the pages that are ranking for the keyword you
want.

These are your competitors for this keyword.

Now for the prospects.

## Prospects

Now you have a CSV with 100 competitors.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-21-at-12.46.51-pm-1024x794-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-21-at-12.46.51-PM.png)

So, from this list of 100 competitors, we find the prospects by using Ahrefs
again.

Take the first URL and add it to Ahrefs > Site Explorer > Backlinks.

**Set filters to** : ""One link per domain"", ""Do Follow"" and then export.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-21_at_12_49_27_pm-1024x543-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen_Shot_2019-10-21_at_12_49_27_PM.png)

This will leave you with another CSV of all the people who LINK to a resource
similar to the one you are trying to rank for (and promote). In this example,
it will give us **_11,968 prospects._**

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-21_at_12_52_12_pm-1024x670-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen_Shot_2019-10-21_at_12_52_12_PM.png)

Repeat this process for all 100 competitors, and then combine the spreadsheets
and you will have an incredible amount of potential prospects to get links
from.

## Find contact information

Once you have a spreadsheet of all your prospects, you simply need to find a
way to contact them.

There are many great ways to get people's contact information these days,
which we cover extensively in our guide on how to find anyone's contact
information.

But since this is still a high-level article, let's keep it simple.

Use a tool like [Hunter](https://devin.to/hunter) to find contact emails from
each prospect's website:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-21-at-1.01.00-pm-1024x421-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-21-at-1.01.00-PM.png)

Or even in bulk:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/bulk-
hunter-1024x395-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/bulk-hunter.png)

## Contact

Now that you have a list of likely-to-link prospects and their contact
information you simply have to reach out (aka outreach) to them!

Send emails to each one of these people introducing yourself and your content
and ask for a link.

Why would people link to you? What's in it for them?

 **Remember** : Link building is always an _exchange of value_.If you built a
really quality piece of content that provides value to your prospects readers,
that is value.

Many times that is enough to get a link. Sometimes not.

You may have to be more creative in order to get a link. Here are some ways
that can improve your chances of getting a link:

  * Paying money
  * Promoting your prospects website to your audience
  * Building a stronger relationship with the person
  * etc.

Each has its own pros & cons

## Get the link

After you figure out the correct value exchange that secures your link -
you've won!

 **Make sure your hard work doesn't go to waste - track your links!**

## When To Start Link Building

Too many SEOs start link building way too early.

This is a mistake for 2 reasons:

  * Link building is easier, faster & more effective when you have a solid foundation.
  * Link building is expensive; you can save money by not link building to some pages that will rank naturally if you get your foundation right.

Getting all the ""pre link building"" stuff done first will save you **_time &
money._**

So before you start link building make sure you have these foundations done
first:

## Analytics

Before spending any money on marketing make sure your analytics are on point.

There is a very famous business quote from Peter Drucker that says: “If you
can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.”

Very true.

You cannot make informed data-backed marketing decisions if you don't have
proper analytics collecting data properly in the first place.

 **Recommendations:**

  * Google Analytics

## Tracking

There is another ""very famous"" quote from Devin Schumacher that says: ""If you
aren't tracking it, your client is inevitably going to fire you because you
can't prove that what you're doing is responsible for their success.""

Very true.

If you can't empirically show yourself, your boss, your team, or your client
that what you are doing is actually making an impact (something that requires
proper analytics).

 **Recommendations:**

  * Google Tag Manager
  * Google Search Console
  * Call Tracking
  * [SEO Tracking](http://serp.app)

## Website Structure

Have a properly setup website structure (aka ""website silo"" or ""sitemap"") is a
critical foundational piece to complete before building links.

Why?

Because when your website is set up properly, you can build links to ONE page
on your site and get the a similar benefit of building links to multiple pages
on a non-siloed site.

For example, if your website is set up properly (with link hubs, and good site
structure) the ""link juice"" from backlinks you acquire will flow to your other
pages more easily, and send the power around via internal links.

flowing-through-a-website-silo.jpg)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/link-juice-flowing-through-a-website-silo.jpg)

 **Recommendations:**

  * Create a proper website silo before building links

## Technical Errors & Optimizations

Technical errors can mess up your website and make it look like a big flaming
pile of SEO poo to search engines.

 **Note** : I wanted to put a poop GIF here, but decided against it. You're
welcome.

They can also negatively affect user experience.

For both of these reasons, you want to fix & optimize all of the technical
aspects that you can before you spend money on links.

 **Technical Optimizations to Look for:**

  * Page speed
  * Mobile-friendliness
  * Keyword cannibalization
  * Duplicate content
  * Canonical errors
  * Duplicate meta information
  * Redirect chains
  * Fix all broken links (404s & broken external links)
  * Improper link rel (dofollow, nofollow, etc.)
  * 

## Content Optimization

Optimize & improve the content on your website for linkability, and
rankability.

Minor optimizations in content can yield significant results from [on-page
SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/) & improve your success with
building backlinks.

 **Recommendations:**

  * Improve the keyword breadth of your articles by running a content audit
  * Identify and improve any ""key pieces of content"" on your website that could attract links

<h2>What is Link Building?</h2>
<p><strong>Link Building Definition:</strong> Link building (aka ""link-building"",
""linkbuilding"", or ""backlinking"") is the process of getting other websites to
hyperlink to your website, with the goal of improving the search engine
rankings of your site.</p>
<p>Links are the primary method of navigation on the internet. They direct humans
(and search engine crawlers) from one web page to another.</p>
<p>Humans (and search engines) inherently associate links as a signal of
authority and trust. For example, if Forbes.com writes an article that has a
link to your website it is generally perceived as a recommendation to go and
check out your business.</p>
<p>Both humans and search engines consider a link like a ""referral"" or
""recommendation"" or ""vote of confidence"" from one site to another.</p>
<p>Getting links to your website is valuable for acquiring new traffic, audience
building, developing relationships, and obviously SEO.</p>
<p>When other authoritative, trusted, and relevant (to your business) websites
link to your website some of their ""power"" is transferred to your website.
This is called ""getting a backlink"".</p>
<p>The more websites that you can get to link to your website (assuming once
again that they themselves are relevant and trusted) the more power your
website will accumulate.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/link-building-
illustration.jpg"" /></p>
<h2>Why is Link Building so important?</h2>
<p>The original Google algorithm was based primarily on evaluating websites based
on how many backlinks a website had from other sites on the internet.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/googles-original-
algorithm-was-based-on-getting-backlinks.png"" /></p>
<p>Even though that was all the way back in 1998 and the algorithm has evolved a
lot since then, having other websites link to you is still one of the top SEO
ranking factors - by far.</p>
<p>The only difference is that today there are a lot more factors which us SEOs
need to understand when acquiring links.</p>
<p>You don't want a link from anyone. You need to be strategic and selective
about who you get links from, and this is the art &amp; science of link building.</p>
<ul>
<li>Link building (done right) improves your domain's authority, power &amp; trust.</li>
<li>Link building is a great way to get traffic from other websites to come to your website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just to drive this point home, here is what happens when you publish content
on your website and then start link building.</p>

<h2>Link Building Fundamentals</h2>
<p>A link (aka hyperlink) is the connection between one webpage and another
webpage.</p>
<h2>Some basic properties of backlinks</h2>
<h2>Internal vs. External</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A link can be an external link, which sends you to some other website. For example, the link in this sentence which sends you to <a href=""http://serp.app"">SERP App, our SEO management tool</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A link can also be an internal link, which sends you to a different webpage on the same website, like <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/"">this link which sends you to our homepage.</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Anchor Text</h2>
<ul>
<li>The clickable part of a link is called <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/anchor-text/"">anchor text</a>, and it gives people (and search engines) a bit of context/information about where they are about to go if they click the link.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dofollow vs. Nofollow</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A link can be <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/do-follow-links/"">dofollow</a>, which means that search engines will crawl the link and transfer power from one website to another. These are the links you normally want to get if possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A link can be <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/no-follow-links/"">nofollow</a>, which means that search engines won't crawl the link and you will not get any power coming to your website. If you can get a nofollow link from a very relevant website it is still good to acquire, but it will not help you out nearly as much as a dofollow link.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Built vs. Earned</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A link can be a ""built link"" which means that you can personally go out and build it whenever you link. An example of this would be posting a tweet with a link to your newest blog article or created a Facebook business page that has a link to your business website in the profile area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A link can also be an ""earned link"" which means that you acquired a link that you cannot build at your own will. An example of this would be another website you don't have editor access to (like Forbes, New York Times, or even a small blogger in your niche) that puts a link to your website somewhere in their content.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Natural vs. Outreached</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A link is considered a ""natural link"" (or natural earned link) if another website links to your website and you never even had to ask. Maybe they just came across your content on their own, liked what they saw, and decided to add a link to your website. Happens all the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A link can also be acquired by using ""outreach"". This means you find a website you want a link from, contact the author of the post or the owner of the website, and ask them to include a link to your website. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Link Building Campaigns</h2>
<p>Now that you know the fundamentals of link building, and why it is important
to build links it's time to talk about how to create a link building campaign
that will grow the organic traffic to your website.</p>
<p>Link building campaigns can be very complex, so it is our goal to give you all
the tools you need to simplify it &amp; succeed.</p>
<p>You will want to have 2 primary types of link building campaigns:</p>
<ul>
<li>A campaign to acquire ""built links""</li>
<li>A campaign to acquire ""earned links""</li>
</ul>
<h2>Built Links Campaign</h2>
<p>This is really less of a ""campaign"" by the definition of the word and more of
just a process you want to follow.</p>
<p>A campaign is defined as ""work in an organized and active way toward a
particular goal, typically a political or social one.""</p>
<p>Colloquially when we talk about a link building campaign we are normally
referring to outreach &amp; earned links.</p>
<p>But, this should really be done after the foundational stuff has been started
so let's go through the basics of ""built links"".</p>
<p>But essentially you want to start by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create all the normal social profiles for your business</li>
<li>Claim your business on various business directories</li>
<li>Engage in conversations with people online (forums, blog post comments, social communities, etc.)</li>
<li>Schedule a press release for something newsworthy</li>
</ul>
<p>We cover this in much more depth in our guide about building backlinks.</p>
<p>Let's keep this train of thought on earned links.</p>
<h2>Link Building Campaign Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>Goals</li>
<li>A quality website</li>
<li>A face of the website (the human element)</li>
<li>Quality content </li>
<li>A Repeatable Process (aka ""system"" or ""SOP"")</li>
<li>Link building tools</li>
<li>Begin!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>What result are you trying to achieve, and how do you plan to measure it?</p>
<p>Every link building campaign needs goals &amp; KPIs (key performance indicators).</p>
<ul>
<li>A goal is an overall broad ambition or effort - the desired end result.</li>
<li>A KPI is a quantifiable measurement used to evaluate the level of success of your campaign.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can have 1 or many goals, and 1 or many KPIs but at least have 1.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of Link Building Campaign goals:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Acquire 10 new unique backlinks</li>
<li>Improve the DR of my website by 5 points</li>
<li>Rank for a certain keyword</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Establish your goal(s), and move forward.</strong></p>
<h2>A quality website</h2>
<p>No one is going to link to you if your website is trash.</p>
<p>Well, I shouldn't say no one because people link to trash websites all the
time - but it will be much harder for you to acquire links if your website
looks bad, untrustworthy, or just downright stupid. Unless your website is
Lings Cars:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/how-does-lings-cars-get-
links.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-does-lings-
cars-get-links-1024x666-1.png"" /></a><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-19-at-2.15.04-PM.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-19-at-2.15.04-pm-1024x166-1.png"" /></a>look at all
those links!</p>
<p>But Lings Cars is an outlier - an exception to the rule. Never create a
strategy around the outliers.</p>
<h2>A human element</h2>
<p>Having a ""face of the website"" is not required, but it is definitely helpful.</p>
<p>People relate to people - not inanimate objections.</p>
<p>If someone can go to your website, see a picture of your, understand who you
are, etc. it will make your job of building relationships (and subsequently
building links) much easier.</p>
<h2>Quality Content</h2>
<p>Quality content (aka ""link-able assets"") is a piece of content on your website
that people get value from.</p>
<p>In ""SEO speak"", quality content means that you have some kind of asset that
another website owner would feel good about linking to.</p>
<p><strong>Example of quality content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A well-written blog post</li>
<li>An expert guide</li>
<li>An awesome infographic</li>
<li>An interactive tool (like a mortgage calculator)</li>
<li>An original piece of research</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong></p>
<p>Other website owners are trying to cultivate trust with their audience and
many times that means having to send their hard-earned visitors somewhere else
to get additional information on a topic.</p>
<p>For example, a social media marketing expert who mentions SEO in her blog
post. Maybe her readers don't really know what SEO is (after all they are
there for social media marketing, which is a different discipline).</p>
<p>She might want to link out to an authority on the subject of SEO so her
readers can get a bit more understanding on the topic - without having to
spend her time writing a bunch of content on SEO - which she may or may not
even be an expert on herself.</p>
<p>Before you can start earning links to your website you need awesome content
that someone would want to link to in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>Identify (or create) quality content on your website.</strong> /cal</p>
<h4>A Repeatable Process</h4>
<p>A successful link building campaign needs to have a standard operating
procedure (SOP).</p>
<p>An SOP allows you (or your team) to carry out complex operations at a high
level of performance, reduce errors and consistently achieve the same awesome
result.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Document everything you have to repeatedly do and turn it into a step-by-
step process that can be followed by anyone on your team.</p>
<p>Author Name</p>
<p><a href=""/"">Tweet</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Link Building Tools</h2>
<p>And finally, you will need some tools.</p>
<p>I am not talking about software that automatically builds links for you.</p>
<p>I am talking about tools like:</p>
<ul>
<li>A place to keep track of prospects (ex: Google Drive or Excel)</li>
<li>A website evaluation tool (ex: Ahrefs or SEM Rush)</li>
<li>Contact information finders (ex: Hunter.io)</li>
<li>Email Schedulers (ex: <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/review/mailshake/"">Mailshake</a> or GMASS)</li>
<li>A CRM (ex: Streak)</li>
<li>A place to track your successful links (ex: <a href=""http://serp.app"">SERP App</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Having the correct tools for the job will allow you to increase your output &amp;
success by 10x, 100x, or even 1000x compared to doing everything manually.</p>
<h2>What Makes a Good Link?</h2>
<p>The key to a successful prospecting phase is to find quality websites.</p>
<p>What makes a website prospect a quality one?</p>
<p>Our team uses an easy to remember acronym when evaluating the quality of a
potential backlink prospect: ART.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A</strong> : Authority</li>
<li><strong>R</strong> : Relevance</li>
<li><strong>T</strong> : Trust or Traffic</li>
</ul>
<p>Evaluating the quality of a. link will be based on these three ART factors -
but keep in mind that you want to be evaluating the A,R,T of not only the
website as a whole but also the specific page where you want to get a link
from (domain-level factors vs. page-level factors).</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/backlink-factors-
on-page-factors-ahrefs-metrics.jpg"" /></p>
<h2>Authority</h2>
<h2>Authority of the page</h2>
<p>The ""authority"" or ""strength"" of a certain webpage comes from the
quantity/quality of backlinks (and interlinks from other authoritative pages)
it has.</p>
<p>Remember that hyperlinks ""pass link power"" to their destination, so if you get
a link from a webpage that has a bunch of links pointing to it you are getting
more power passed directly to your page.</p>
<p>For example, if I was running a link building campaign to improve the rankings
of my <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/keyword-research/"">Keyword Research</a>
article, I would rather have a link from Ahrefs.com on this page with 692
referring domains:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-19_at_3_36_01_pm.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-19_at_3_36_01_pm.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Then this page with 1:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/1-1.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/1-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>You can easily check the authority of a website by looking at the ""UR"" in
Ahrefs. Be sure to enter the entire URL into site explorer so you get the
stats on. the specific page:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen_Shot_2019-10-21_at_12_18_20_PM.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-21_at_12_18_20_pm-1024x247-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Try to get links from web pages that have a lot of links themselves.</strong></p>
<h2>Authority of the domain</h2>
<p>The ""authority"" or ""strength"" of an entire website comes from the
quantity/quality of backlinks the whole website has coming to all of its
pages.</p>
<p>In general, getting a link from a very strong website, like Forbes, would be
much more ""powerful"" than a link from some unknown blog.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/authority-links-
carry-more-weight-illustration.jpg"" /></p>
<p>You can easily check the authority of a website by looking at the DR in
Ahrefs:</p>

<h2>Relevance</h2>
<h2>Domain-level Relevance</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keywords in Domain</strong> : Getting a link from a website with relevant keywords in the domain adds relevance.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Page-level Relevance</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keywords in URL</strong> : Getting a link from a website with relevant keywords in the page URL adds relevance.</li>
<li><strong>Keywords in Page Title</strong> : Getting a link from a website with relevant keywords in the Page Title adds relevance.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Link-level Relevance</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anchor text</strong> : The clickable portion of the link adds relevance. Keywords in anchor text add relevance, but you need to be careful with this. </li>

<h2>A Sample of Link Building in Action</h2>
<p>The first step of your link building campaign will be to identify a list of
prospects.</p>
<p>This means creating a spreadsheet of URLs that you would want links from -
other websites in your industry that have already built up some authority.</p>
<p>We've covered all the basics now.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about how this looks in practice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Find Competitors &amp; Prospects</li>
<li>Find contact information</li>
<li>Contact</li>
<li>Get a link</li>
</ul>
<h2>Find competitors &amp; prospects</h2>
<h2>Competitors</h2>
<p>Prospects are other websites that would be most likely to link to your
content. To find them, we must first find your competitors. Super easy to do.</p>
<p>The obvious websites that make good prospects are websites that have <em>already
linked to similar content as yours</em>.</p>
<p>Simply go to Ahrefs &gt; Keywords Explorer and pop in the KEYWORD that you are
trying to rank for.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen_Shot_2019-10-21_at_12_39_23_PM.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-21_at_12_39_23_pm-1024x508-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Scroll down to ""SERP Overview"", expand the results to 100, and export the
list:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen_Shot_2019-10-21_at_12_42_12_PM.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-21_at_12_42_12_pm-1024x453-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Now you have a list of all the pages that are ranking for the keyword you
want.</p>
<p>These are your competitors for this keyword.</p>
<p>Now for the prospects.</p>
<h2>Prospects</h2>
<p>Now you have a CSV with 100 competitors.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-21-at-12.46.51-PM.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-21-at-12.46.51-pm-1024x794-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>So, from this list of 100 competitors, we find the prospects by using Ahrefs
again.</p>
<p>Take the first URL and add it to Ahrefs &gt; Site Explorer &gt; Backlinks.</p>
<p><strong>Set filters to</strong> : ""One link per domain"", ""Do Follow"" and then export.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

<p>This will leave you with another CSV of all the people who LINK to a resource
similar to the one you are trying to rank for (and promote). In this example,
it will give us <strong><em>11,968 prospects.</em></strong></p>

<p>Repeat this process for all 100 competitors, and then combine the spreadsheets
and you will have an incredible amount of potential prospects to get links
from.</p>
<h2>Find contact information</h2>
<p>Once you have a spreadsheet of all your prospects, you simply need to find a
way to contact them.</p>
<p>There are many great ways to get people's contact information these days,
which we cover extensively in our guide on how to find anyone's contact
information.</p>
<p>But since this is still a high-level article, let's keep it simple.</p>
<p>Use a tool like <a href=""https://devin.to/hunter"">Hunter</a> to find contact emails from
each prospect's website:</p>

<p>Or even in bulk:</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>Now that you have a list of likely-to-link prospects and their contact
information you simply have to reach out (aka outreach) to them!</p>
<p>Send emails to each one of these people introducing yourself and your content
and ask for a link.</p>
<p>Why would people link to you? What's in it for them?</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong> : Link building is always an <em>exchange of value</em>.If you built a
really quality piece of content that provides value to your prospects readers,
that is value.</p>
<p>Many times that is enough to get a link. Sometimes not.</p>
<p>You may have to be more creative in order to get a link. Here are some ways
that can improve your chances of getting a link:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying money</li>
<li>Promoting your prospects website to your audience</li>
<li>Building a stronger relationship with the person</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each has its own pros &amp; cons</p>
<h2>Get the link</h2>
<p>After you figure out the correct value exchange that secures your link -
you've won!</p>
<p><strong>Make sure your hard work doesn't go to waste - track your links!</strong></p>
<h2>When To Start Link Building</h2>
<p>Too many SEOs start link building way too early.</p>
<p>This is a mistake for 2 reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Link building is easier, faster &amp; more effective when you have a solid foundation.</li>
<li>Link building is expensive; you can save money by not link building to some pages that will rank naturally if you get your foundation right.</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting all the ""pre link building"" stuff done first will save you <strong><em>time &amp;
money.</em></strong></p>
<p>So before you start link building make sure you have these foundations done
first:</p>
<h2>Analytics</h2>
<p>Before spending any money on marketing make sure your analytics are on point.</p>
<p>There is a very famous business quote from Peter Drucker that says: “If you
can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.”</p>
<p>Very true.</p>
<p>You cannot make informed data-backed marketing decisions if you don't have
proper analytics collecting data properly in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Google Analytics</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tracking</h2>
<p>There is another ""very famous"" quote from Devin Schumacher that says: ""If you
aren't tracking it, your client is inevitably going to fire you because you
can't prove that what you're doing is responsible for their success.""</p>
<p>Very true.</p>
<p>If you can't empirically show yourself, your boss, your team, or your client
that what you are doing is actually making an impact (something that requires
proper analytics).</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Google Tag Manager</li>
<li>Google Search Console</li>
<li>Call Tracking</li>
<li><a href=""http://serp.app"">SEO Tracking</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Website Structure</h2>
<p>Have a properly setup website structure (aka ""website silo"" or ""sitemap"") is a
critical foundational piece to complete before building links.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because when your website is set up properly, you can build links to ONE page
on your site and get the a similar benefit of building links to multiple pages
on a non-siloed site.</p>
<p>For example, if your website is set up properly (with link hubs, and good site
structure) the ""link juice"" from backlinks you acquire will flow to your other
pages more easily, and send the power around via internal links.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

flowing-through-a-website-silo.jpg"" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a proper website silo before building links</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technical Errors &amp; Optimizations</h2>
<p>Technical errors can mess up your website and make it look like a big flaming
pile of SEO poo to search engines.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> : I wanted to put a poop GIF here, but decided against it. You're
welcome.</p>
<p>They can also negatively affect user experience.</p>
<p>For both of these reasons, you want to fix &amp; optimize all of the technical
aspects that you can before you spend money on links.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Optimizations to Look for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Page speed</li>
<li>Mobile-friendliness</li>
<li>Keyword cannibalization</li>
<li>Duplicate content</li>
<li>Canonical errors</li>
<li>Duplicate meta information</li>
<li>Redirect chains</li>
<li>Fix all broken links (404s &amp; broken external links)</li>
<li>Improper link rel (dofollow, nofollow, etc.)</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h2>Content Optimization</h2>
<p>Optimize &amp; improve the content on your website for linkability, and
rankability.</p>
<p>Minor optimizations in content can yield significant results from <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/"">on-page
SEO</a> &amp; improve your success with
building backlinks.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the keyword breadth of your articles by running a content audit</li>
<li>Identify and improve any ""key pieces of content"" on your website that could attract links</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Link Building takes a lot of work but pays off in spades.</p>

URL is short for Uniform Resource Locator. It is commonly referred to as the
_website address_.

It can be found at the top of your web browser.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-3.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-3.png)

The URL is basically the digital street address of a website. The internet is
one big city and Google is the street directory. Every website is a house and
has its own street address.

Makes sense? Ok.

 **A URL has 4 main components.**

[![url structure for seo](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/seo-url.jpg)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/seo-url.jpg) source: seopressor

  *  **The Protocol** —HTTP/HTTPS
  *  **The Domain Name** —The website name + top-level domain (.com, .net etc...) 
  * **The Subdirectories** —The group housing individual webpages
  *  **The Individual Page Name** —The name of one specific webpage 

See how it's similar to a street address? You have the city, the suburb, the
street, and the number.

Not all websites _show_ the protocol. We don't. It still is technically
there... Our website is still HTTPS protected. It just isn't shown.

It's purely marketing/aesthetics.

Note: You can break down the URL into more than 4 parts—but it's unnecessary
for SEO. Best to keep things simple.

## Why Is URL Structure Important For SEO?

Because it affects SEO.

Search engines like Google use your URL/website address to better understand
your content. Googlebot uses URLs to crawl, rank and index.

An optimized URL makes it easier to do just that.

It's both an entire website, and an individual webpage issue. URLs matter for
SEO at both levels.

URLs can also dramatically affect organic click-through rates - a [search
engine ranking factor](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/).

## URL Structure Best Practices

  * Feature A Keyword
  * Keep URL Short
  * Use HTTPS
  * Use Hyphens (Not Underscores)
  * Make URL Descriptive
  * No Capitalization (All Lowercase)
  * Create Well-Structured URL Subfolders

## Feature A Keyword

Your URL needs to have a keyword.

_Why?_

Aside from [Google's own SEO
](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en)[guide
](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en)recommending
it...

 **2 reasons why.**

  * It is an SEO ranking factor.
  * Improves click-through rates. 

Google Webmaster Trends Analyst John Mueller had this to say about URL
keywords in 2016:

> ""I believe that is a very small ranking factor. So it is not something I'd
> really try to force. And it is not something I’d say it is even worth your
> effort to restructure your site just so you can get keywords in your URL.""
>
> [John Mueller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmu/), 2016.

Let me be clear - he is either lying, ignorant, or misrepresenting having
keywords in URL. They are not a very small ranking factor. They are a MAJOR
ranking factor.

What's more important, is the effect a keyword in the URL can have on click-
through rates.

Research from Backlinko has shown [a keyword-rich URL can increase CTR by
45%](https://backlinko.com/google-ctr-stats).

But don't go overboard. 1 keyword is fine. 2 at most.

## Keep URLs Short

The length of a URL can affect your SEO efforts.

So... What is the optimal URL length?

In general, shorter is better. Research from Ahrefs shows #1 ranking webpages
have significantly shorter URLs.

17 characters for the #1 rank to be precise.

The average word has 6 characters. 17 characters is generally 2-4 words.

[Backlinko's ranking factors study](https://backlinko.com/search-engine-
ranking) came to a similar conclusion.

All the research and data on URL length is consistent. The consensus is
overwhelmingly clear—shorter is better.

For good measure, here's what [Matt Cutts of Google said about URL
length](https://www.stephanspencer.com/matt-cutts-interview/).

> ""Certainly. If you can make your title four- or five-words long – and it is
> pretty natural. If you have got a three, four or five words in your URL,
> that can be perfectly normal. As it gets a little longer, then it starts to
> look a little worse. Now, our algorithms typically will just weight those
> words less and just not give you as much credit.""
>
> [Matt Cutts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattcutts)

There you go. 3-5 words.

Another pro-tip on this topic of short URLs is URL depth, which we cover
below.

**BOTTOM LINE:** Keep URL length short if you can.

## Use HTTPS

Using HTTPS will improve your SEO efforts.

Google has called for HTTPS usage to be universal across the web. This is a
part of the companies ideology—a safer internet for all. As such [they
consider HTTPS a ranking
signal](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-
signal.html).

Google also straight-out recommends HTTPS in its [SEO starter
guide](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en).

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-15-2.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-15-2.png)

Google clearly favors HTTPS.

There does seem to be a slight correlation between HTTPS usage and higher SERP
rank—according to Backlinko research.

Top ranking domains tend to use HTTPS.

Switching from HTTP to HTTPS is quite technical—this might not be at the top
of ones SEO ""to-do list."" Ideally you want to create a website with HTTPS from
the get-go.

  *  **Further Reading** : [HTTP vs HTTPS](https://devinschumacher.com/http-vs-https/)

 **BOTTOM LINE:** Use HTTPS.

## Use Hyphens (Not Underscores)

When you have a URL with multiple words, you want to use hyphens (-) to break
it up.

 **EXAMPLE:** staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/google-ranking-factors

If you don't break up the words, Google will process it as
/googlerankingfactors ... One long word.

Not good.

Use hyphens (-) to break up words in your URL to make it easier for Google to
understand. When you make it easier for Google to understand your
content/webpages, you get better SERP results.

In fact, Google recommends the use of hyphens in URLs.

They even mention specifically not to use underscores (_). In fact Google
straight out ignores them as a URL separator.

The hyphen is the universal URL separator [according to Google's Matt
Cutts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3SFVfDIS5k).

**GOOD ✔** staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/google-ranking-factors

**BAD ✖** staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/google_ranking_factors

**BAD ✖** staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/googlerankingfactors

This really does not need to get more complicated

**BOTTOM LINE:** Use Hyphens (-) to break up multiple words in your URL.

## Make your URLs Clear & Descriptive

A descriptive URL can entice search engine users to click through.

Which URL would you be more likely to click?

 **staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/34569010/p=v2ha780sdf32**

or

**staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/google-ranking-factors**

Exactly.

A URL that is descriptive gives a search engine user context to what the page
is about. Now yes, SERP results have page titles and meta descriptions, but a
good URL can support that.

SERPs are not the only place a link can be featured—social platforms like
Reddit, online forums or Twitter. A non-descriptive URL is less likely to be
clicked on those places too.

A descriptive URL is important for SEO because it can improve click-through
rate. Organic click-through rate is what we call a user experience signal.
Google uses these to better rank content/webpages.

Essentially, organic click-through rate is a ranking factor.

Creating a descriptive URL is not hard or complicated. If you adhere to the
other best practice guidelines—such as featuring a keyword and keeping it
short, it should be enough.

 **GOOD ✔** staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/google-ranking-factors

**BAD ✖** staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/ 34569010/p=v2ha780sdf32

**BOTTOM LINE:** Create ""descriptive"" URLs to increase click-through rate.

## No Capitalization (All Lowercase)

Capitalization does not make a difference to Google—but the server your
website is hosted on might. Most servers consider **/google-ranking-factors**
the same as **/Google-ranking-factors**.

Not all do though—which is why you should stick with no capitalization.

Windows is case insensitive. **/google-ranking-factors** is the same as
**/Google-ranking-factors**.

Linux is case sensitive. It will consider those two pages entirely different.
Having multiple pages for the same content is not good, the link juice will be
spread.

To avoid server case sensitivity problems altogether, just avoid
capitalization—use lowercase.

 **GOOD ✔** staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/google-ranking-factors

**BAD ✖** staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/Google-ranking-factors

**BOTTOM LINE:** Avoid URL capitalization for web server optimization

## Create Well-Structured URL Subfolders

Well-structured, organized URL subfolders make it easy for Googlebot to crawl
your website—indexing and ranking you well.

It can also make navigation of your website easy for visitors.

Google echoes these sentiments. Here's a [quote from its SEO starter
guide](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en).

>  
> “The navigation of a website is important in helping visitors quickly find
> the content they want. It can also help search engines understand what
> content the webmaster thinks is important.”

Google wants to know what role an individual webpage plays on the overall
website. Making a clear, concise URL subfolder will boost the ranking of
individual pages.

Remember, website architecture plays a role in on-page SEO.

An organized URL subfolder improves SEO much like improving site speed, or
using a responsive design. Website features affect the SEO of individual
webpages.

So how do we create well-structured URL subfolders?

 **Best practice is quite simple according to Google.**

  * Create a natural flowing hierarchy—avoid overly complex webs of links
  * Use text for navigation—avoid navigation based on images/animations 

Here's how we do it at SERP Co.

Our learning hub starts with the ""University"" subfolder.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-17-1024x443-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/image-17.png)

From here the learning hub splits into two sections ""Content"" and ""SEO.""

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-18-2.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-18-2.png)

Here hosted are the individual webpages.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-20-1024x339-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/image-20.png)

The URL path is **“University” → “SEO” → “Intro” → “What Is SEO”**

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-22-2.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-22-2.png)

Clean, smooth. Easy for Googlebot to crawl.

This post would be **“University” → “SEO” → “On-Page” → “URL Structure”**.

 ** _Pro-Tip_** _: This is great for organization and site structure, and
navigation but not great for SEO rankings._

Notice how we have so many levels, but when you look at the actual URL of the
page you don't see all those sub-folders in the final URL, you see something
different...

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-25-at-2.09.43-pm-1024x30-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-25-at-2.09.43-PM.png)

Why is that?

Keeping your keywords closer to the root domain is going to significantly help
your rankings.

 _The fewer subfolders you use the better you will rank. Plain and simple.
People deny this all the time but I personally have tested and seen this fact
in action hundreds of times._

For example, if you want to rank for ""Los Angeles SEO Company"" you would be
better off with Option 1 than Option 2:

  *  **Option 1** : yourwebsite.com/los-angeles-seo-company
  *  **Option 2** : yourtwebsite.com/services/seo/california/los-angeles

You see, each time you add another / into the URL it is actually a
""subfolder"". This is called URL depth. Shorter URL depths have been shown to
help rankings.

This is how it looks on the server-side:

 **Option 1:**

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/url-depth-as-a-
ranking-factor.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/url-depth-as-a-ranking-factor.png)

 **Option 2:**

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/url-depth-as-a-
ranking-factor-2-1024x37-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/url-depth-as-a-ranking-factor-2.png)

If you look at our website, we actually go against our own advice here - but
not because we don't believe in it. We do it out of necessity.

We just have way too many ""local landing pages"" to have all these short URL
structures.

We needed to use sub-folders for organizational purposes, or things would have
_gotten_ ** _a little too crazy_** for us to manage.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/download-19.gif)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/download-19.gif)

 **BOTTOM LINE:** Keep URL subfolders simple and text-based.

signal</a>.</p>
<p>Google also straight-out recommends HTTPS in its <a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en"">SEO starter
guide</a>.</p>

<p>Google clearly favors HTTPS.</p>
<p>There does seem to be a slight correlation between HTTPS usage and higher SERP
rank—according to Backlinko research.</p>
<p>Top ranking domains tend to use HTTPS.</p>
<p>Switching from HTTP to HTTPS is quite technical—this might not be at the top
of ones SEO ""to-do list."" Ideally you want to create a website with HTTPS from
the get-go.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Further Reading</strong> : <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/http-vs-https/"">HTTP vs HTTPS</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BOTTOM LINE:</strong> Use HTTPS.</p>
<h2>Use Hyphens (Not Underscores)</h2>
<p>When you have a URL with multiple words, you want to use hyphens (-) to break
it up.</p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong> staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/google-ranking-factors</p>
<p>If you don't break up the words, Google will process it as
/googlerankingfactors ... One long word.</p>
<p>Not good.</p>
<p>Use hyphens (-) to break up words in your URL to make it easier for Google to
understand. When you make it easier for Google to understand your
content/webpages, you get better SERP results.</p>
<p>In fact, Google recommends the use of hyphens in URLs.</p>
<p>They even mention specifically not to use underscores (_). In fact Google
straight out ignores them as a URL separator.</p>
<p>The hyphen is the universal URL separator <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3SFVfDIS5k"">according to Google's Matt
Cutts</a>.</p>

<p><strong>BAD ✖</strong> staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/googlerankingfactors</p>
<p>This really does not need to get more complicated</p>
<p><strong>BOTTOM LINE:</strong> Use Hyphens (-) to break up multiple words in your URL.</p>
<h2>Make your URLs Clear &amp; Descriptive</h2>
<p>A descriptive URL can entice search engine users to click through.</p>
<p>Which URL would you be more likely to click?</p>
<p><strong>staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/34569010/p=v2ha780sdf32</strong></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><strong>staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/google-ranking-factors</strong></p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>A URL that is descriptive gives a search engine user context to what the page
is about. Now yes, SERP results have page titles and meta descriptions, but a
good URL can support that.</p>
<p>SERPs are not the only place a link can be featured—social platforms like
Reddit, online forums or Twitter. A non-descriptive URL is less likely to be
clicked on those places too.</p>
<p>A descriptive URL is important for SEO because it can improve click-through
rate. Organic click-through rate is what we call a user experience signal.
Google uses these to better rank content/webpages.</p>
<p>Essentially, organic click-through rate is a ranking factor.</p>
<p>Creating a descriptive URL is not hard or complicated. If you adhere to the
other best practice guidelines—such as featuring a keyword and keeping it
short, it should be enough.</p>
<p><strong>GOOD ✔</strong> staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/google-ranking-factors</p>
<p><strong>BAD ✖</strong> staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/ 34569010/p=v2ha780sdf32</p>
<p><strong>BOTTOM LINE:</strong> Create ""descriptive"" URLs to increase click-through rate.</p>
<h2>No Capitalization (All Lowercase)</h2>
<p>Capitalization does not make a difference to Google—but the server your
website is hosted on might. Most servers consider <strong>/google-ranking-factors</strong>
the same as <strong>/Google-ranking-factors</strong>.</p>
<p>Not all do though—which is why you should stick with no capitalization.</p>
<p>Windows is case insensitive. <strong>/google-ranking-factors</strong> is the same as
<strong>/Google-ranking-factors</strong>.</p>
<p>Linux is case sensitive. It will consider those two pages entirely different.
Having multiple pages for the same content is not good, the link juice will be
spread.</p>
<p>To avoid server case sensitivity problems altogether, just avoid
capitalization—use lowercase.</p>
<p><strong>GOOD ✔</strong> staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/google-ranking-factors</p>
<p><strong>BAD ✖</strong> staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/Google-ranking-factors</p>
<p><strong>BOTTOM LINE:</strong> Avoid URL capitalization for web server optimization</p>
<h2>Create Well-Structured URL Subfolders</h2>
<p>Well-structured, organized URL subfolders make it easy for Googlebot to crawl
your website—indexing and ranking you well.</p>
<p>It can also make navigation of your website easy for visitors.</p>
<p>Google echoes these sentiments. Here's a <a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en"">quote from its SEO starter
guide</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The navigation of a website is important in helping visitors quickly find
the content they want. It can also help search engines understand what
content the webmaster thinks is important.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google wants to know what role an individual webpage plays on the overall
website. Making a clear, concise URL subfolder will boost the ranking of
individual pages.</p>
<p>Remember, website architecture plays a role in on-page SEO.</p>
<p>An organized URL subfolder improves SEO much like improving site speed, or
using a responsive design. Website features affect the SEO of individual
webpages.</p>
<p>So how do we create well-structured URL subfolders?</p>
<p><strong>Best practice is quite simple according to Google.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a natural flowing hierarchy—avoid overly complex webs of links</li>
<li>Use text for navigation—avoid navigation based on images/animations </li>
</ul>
<p>Here's how we do it at SERP Co.</p>
<p>Our learning hub starts with the ""University"" subfolder.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/image-17.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-17-1024x443-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>From here the learning hub splits into two sections ""Content"" and ""SEO.""</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-18-2.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-18-2.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Here hosted are the individual webpages.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/image-20.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-20-1024x339-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>The URL path is <strong>“University” → “SEO” → “Intro” → “What Is SEO”</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-22-2.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-22-2.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Clean, smooth. Easy for Googlebot to crawl.</p>
<p>This post would be <strong>“University” → “SEO” → “On-Page” → “URL Structure”</strong>.</p>
<p>** <em>Pro-Tip</em>** <em>: This is great for organization and site structure, and
navigation but not great for SEO rankings.</em></p>
<p>Notice how we have so many levels, but when you look at the actual URL of the
page you don't see all those sub-folders in the final URL, you see something
different...</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-25-at-2.09.43-PM.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-25-at-2.09.43-pm-1024x30-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Keeping your keywords closer to the root domain is going to significantly help
your rankings.</p>
<p><em>The fewer subfolders you use the better you will rank. Plain and simple.
People deny this all the time but I personally have tested and seen this fact
in action hundreds of times.</em></p>
<p>For example, if you want to rank for ""Los Angeles SEO Company"" you would be
better off with Option 1 than Option 2:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option 1</strong> : yourwebsite.com/los-angeles-seo-company</li>
<li><strong>Option 2</strong> : yourtwebsite.com/services/seo/california/los-angeles</li>
</ul>
<p>You see, each time you add another / into the URL it is actually a
""subfolder"". This is called URL depth. Shorter URL depths have been shown to
help rankings.</p>
<p>This is how it looks on the server-side:</p>
<p><strong>Option 1:</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/url-depth-as-a-ranking-factor.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/url-depth-as-a-
ranking-factor.png"" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Option 2:</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/url-depth-as-a-ranking-factor-2.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/url-depth-as-a-
ranking-factor-2-1024x37-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>If you look at our website, we actually go against our own advice here - but
not because we don't believe in it. We do it out of necessity.</p>
<p>We just have way too many ""local landing pages"" to have all these short URL
structures.</p>
<p>We needed to use sub-folders for organizational purposes, or things would have
<em>gotten</em> ** <em>a little too crazy</em>** for us to manage.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/download-19.gif""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/download-19.gif"" /></a></p>
<p><strong>BOTTOM LINE:</strong> Keep URL subfolders simple and text-based.</p>

In this article, we will map out every type of backlink that's worth building,
teach you how to build them, and even what order they should be built in for
maximum SEO impact.

Everything we discuss here is practiced daily in our agency and fuels our
website rankings (and our clients' website rankings)

 **Note** : Please read our article on [Link
Building](https://devinschumacher.com/link-building/) before you go through
this. It provides a very clear, conceptual and high-level look at how this all
works from a 30,000-foot bird's eye view.

This guide on backlinks will discuss, in detail, all the different types of
backlinks and how to get them - but without the context of what & why from our
link building article, it may be less clear what you should do.

## What are backlinks?

Backlinks (aka ""back links"", ""back-links"", ""links"", “inbound links”, etc.) are
hyperlinks that point to your website but come  _from_  other websites.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/what-are-
backlinks.jpg)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/what-
are-backlinks.jpg)

When a Website A hyperlinks to Website B, you can say that Website B just
acquired a ""backlink"" from Website A.

Simple enough, right?

## Why Are Backlinks Important?

Search engines (especially Google) use backlinks as a [ranking
factor](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/).

Backlinks are analogous to “votes”, ""referrals"", a ""vouch"" or ""recommendation""
about your website and its content.

Very similar real life, when multiple people recommend a movie, or restaurant,
or music artist, you tend to become interested & develop a sense of trust for
that thing. Google works the same way.

The more (quality + relevant) backlinks your website acquires, the higher your
content & keywords will rank, and the more relevant traffic will come to your
website.

It's awesome.

## How to Get Backlinks

Backlinks fall into **2 main types:**

  1. Built
  2. Earned

This means that some links you can go out and _build_ yourself. This would
include things like:

  * Social profile links
  * Blog comments
  * Forum signature links
  * Business directory listings
  * etc.

Other links you have to earn. This would include things like:

  * Getting a link on another bloggers website
  * Getting a link from a story written in Techcrunch
  * etc.

Although there are only two real types of links, there are **3 ways to get
backlinks.**

  1. Build
  2. Earn (Naturally or Un-naturally)
  3. Buy

We will try to break up & organize this guide by backlinks you can ""Build"" vs.
backlinks, you must ""Earn"". And, if there is a place to buy them (ex: from a
trusted link building service provider) we will mention that in each link
write-up.

### A quick note on link builders & link building services

There is a seemingly endless amount of link building service providers on the
internet.

Really, you can find everything from Citations to SAPE if you know where to
look.

Buying links from the wrong person can get you into serious SEO trouble.

Be careful who you get links from.

We only recommend getting links from very trusted providers, and we will never
recommend someone we have not worked with before - at least not without a
gigantic disclaimer.

Make sure you fully trust & vet any person or company before purchasing links
from them.

## What Makes a Link Good?

There are some properties that make a link good, and knowing how to evaluate
link opportunities is a crucial skill to develop for conducting a successful
SEO campaign.

We cover this in detail in our [Link Building Intro
Guide](https://devinschumacher.com/link-building/), but it's worth re-capping
a few of the main points here as well.

 **Things that make backlinks good:**

  *  **A** uthority
  *  **R** elevance
  *  **T** raffic

## Backlinks to Avoid

Up to this point, we have talked a lot about back links you should acquire,
which kind to get and how to do it.

But, equally important to the backlinks you GET is the ones to AVOID getting.

The key to mastering this (without having to memorize a bunch of stuff) is to
learn how to identify a ""bad neighborhood"" - and avoid being associated with
it.

 **In general, you want to avoid getting links from:**

  * Irrelevant websites (unless they are very high DR)
  * Domains in questionable geographies
  * Domains that have been hacked/spammed
  * Domains with toxic or over-optimized anchor text
  * Public Blog Networks
  * Software built backlinks
  * Fiverr

### Public Blog Networks

A public blog network is really just a PBN (private blog network) that isn't
actually private.

Building and maintaining a private blog network is very time consuming,
expensive, technically difficult, and overall just one giant P.I.T.A.

However, if done well and kept secret they are extremely powerful.

The problem is there are many providers that publicly sell links on their
""Private"" Blog Networking - thus making it a ""Public Blog Network"". They
usually don't have your best interests in mind they just want some money for a
link. Do not get these links.

### Software built backlinks

There are a lot of software is the build backlinks these days. They are cheap,
fast & can build links in huge quantities.

This used to work many years ago, but now it is really just a recipe for
disaster.

Unless you really know what you are doing stay away from using software to
build links.

### Fiverr

A lot of SEOs go to Fiverr for link building work. Terrible idea.

Although there may be the occasional quality link provider on Fiverr - for the
most part these people are spammers who are trying to make some easy money.
They don't care about you, or your client, or your website or anything other
than selling garbage.

Do you really think this is worth this dude's time to build you 500,000 links
for $5? And do you really think it would be natural for Google to see 500,000
links come to your site all of a sudden?

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/backlinks-from-
fiverr-1024x541-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/backlinks-from-fiverr.png)

The answer is **Duck No.**

Avoid Fiverr for backlinks.

### Evaluating a Potential Backlink Opportunity

Here is a video talking about a guest post opportunity I was presented with,
but that I ultimately deemed to be a bad idea. In the video, I talk briefly
about some warning signs and walk through my thought process on why it was a
good idea to not pursue this link opportunity.

## How To Build High-Quality Backlinks, In The Proper Order

Hopefully, by now, you have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of
backlinks:

  * What they are
  * Why they are important
  * How to evaluate them
  * Which ones to avoid

If so, then it's time to get building.

We like to build backlinks in a certain order that follows the most natural
progression of backlink types that a website would pick up if they were just
doing what most people do.

  1. Foundational Social Profiles
  2. Foundational Business Directories
  3. General Business Directories
  4. Niche Business Directories
  5. Location Business Directories
  6. General Business Authority links
  7. Industry Authority links
  8. Extra Social Profiles
  9. Web 2.0 Blogs
  10. Press Release
  11. Niche relevant blog comments
  12. Niche relevant forum/community links
  13. Guest posts
  14. Link outreach
  15. Competitor Backlinks
  16. PBN links

### Foundational Social Profiles

Foundational social profiles are the primary social networking profiles that a
normal business owner would set up and utilize for marketing and social
promotion.

In fact, there are some social profiles that are so commonly used that Google
expects you to have them if you are a real/legitimate business.

They even list them in their guidelines found
[here](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/social-profile).

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-28-at-3.44.13-pm-1024x573-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-28-at-3.44.13-PM.png)

Start your backlink building by building business profiles on these
foundational profiles.

  * Facebook Business Page
  * Twitter
  * Linkedin Business Page
  * Instagram
  * YouTube
  * Pinterest (if visual content is relevant to your industry)

 **Pro-tip** : Fully fill-out/complete these profiles with images, videos,
descriptions, your website URL, NAP (name address phone number), store hours,
etc. Use ""about"" sections to add information about the services you provide
using variations of keywords.

### Foundational Business Directories

After a business sets up its social profiles, the next natural thing to do is
create a profile on the major business directories so your business can show
up in maps when consumers are searching.

These include:

  * Yelp
  * Google My Business
  * Bing Maps
  * Apple Maps
  * Waze
  * Mapquest

Make sure you create a presence on all of the properties - and just like
social foundations be sure to fill in as much information as you can.

### General Business Directories

content/uploads/2022/08/online_directories-1024x436-1.jpg)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/online_directories.jpg)

General business directories come next.

These include a ton of other high authority business directories, such as:

  * Yellowpages
  * Dex
  * Brownbook
  * Foursquare
  * Manta
  * Citysearch
  * etc.

The key to setting up these business directories correctly is to make sure
that your information across **all of your directories is consistent.**

Having a consistent NAP (name, address, phone number) on all the popular
business directories will significantly help you to show up highly in map
searches when customers are looking for a business in your industry and
geography.

### Niche Business Directories

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/healthcare-review-
sites.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/healthcare-
review-sites.png)

Niche business directories are the web directories that are specific to your
niche, or at least to your broad industry.

For example, if you are a Dentist you would want to get your practice listed
on dental-specific directories like:

  * 1800dentist.com
  * dentists.com
  * etc.

You would also want to have a presence on the broader industry level health-
related directories like:

  * wellness.com
  * webmd.com
  * vitals.com
  * doctor.com
  * etc.

You can find niche directories by Googling them or just contact us for a list.

 **Use these ""search strings"" in a Google search to find NICHE directories:**

  * NICHE + Directory (ex: dentist + directory)
  * NICHE directories (ex: dentist directories)
  * NICHE + “submit site” (ex: dentist + ""submit site"")

Make a list of relevant NICHE directories (use Google search or ask us for a
pre-vetted list) and get listed!

### Location Business Directories

Just like there are business directories categorized by industry/niche there
are business directories categorized by locale/geography.

If your business is located in a certain city you would want to have a
presence on the relevant directories to that city.

For example, let's pretend you have a business in Los Angeles, California.

Some directories that would be relevant and important for you to have listings
in the city-specific directories like:

  * businessdirectorylosangeles.com
  * mylocal.latimes.com
  * losangelesbusinessweb.com
  * smallbizla.org/directory
  * etc.

 **Use these ""search strings"" in a Google search to find GEO directories:**

  * city + directory
  * directory + city
  * submit my site + city
  * niche + city + directory
  * city + directories

Make a list of relevant GEO directories (use Google search or ask us for a
pre-vetted list) and get listed!

### General Business Authority links

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/dtv_installation_bbb_accredited_a-1024x495-1.jpg)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/dtv_installation_bbb_accredited_a.jpg)

Business authority links are places similar to business directories but are
actually paid.

These include very trusted, authoritative business websites like:

  * BBB.com
  * ChamberOfCommerce.com
  * etc.

These are paid associations where Google recognizes legitimacy.

The logic is that if you are willing to pay money for an annual subscription
at these business websites, you are less likely to be a spammer and more
likely to be a legitimate business that should show up in the maps & on
organic search.

 **Note** : Yes they are paid, but the links and trust you get from them are
very good. Also, many of these places have a ton of other benefits for your
business other than just a link - like networking, etc.

### Industry Authority links

Industry authority links are like the ""general business authority links"" -
except they are specific to your industry.

Think of Paid Industry Associations, Colleges or Schools you went to, Industry
organizations you are a part of, Industry-specific charities or non-profits
you donate to, etc.

All of these places are potential websites to get backlinks from, and they are
very impactful for your SEO.

For example, an attorney might want to have a profile on the California State
Bar Association website, a profile from the Law School he/she graduated from,
etc.

### Extra Social Profiles

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/social-network-
backlinks.jpg)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/social-
network-backlinks.jpg)

Getting additional links from High DR properties is never really a bad idea -
unless they are questionable websites like adult-themes, gambling, etc. or
there is something glaringly weird about it.

But in general the more high DR links you have, the better.

They help diversify your link profile, anchor text ratio and build trust.

We have a service that will build around 100 social profiles for you on high
authority, trusted websites which we see a huge SEO benefit from.

[Contact us](https://devinschumacher.com/contact/) for details.

### Web 2.0 Blogs

The term ""Web 2.0"" refers to websites that emphasize user-generated content.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/web-2.0-definition.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/web-2.0-definition.png)

### Press Release

A press release, news release, media release, press statement or video release
is an official statement delivered to members of the news media for the
purpose of providing information, an official statement, or making an
announcement ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_release)).

Businesses use press releases every day to make announcements they want the
general public to know about, like opening a new store.

Using a Press Release can be a strategic move for your SEO.

**Note** : You generally want these links to be NOFOLLOW. One of the rare
occasions where you do not want DOFOLLOW links. You also want to keep your
anchor text to either Brand Name or Naked URL.

### Niche relevant blog comments

Getting blog comments is something natural if you are a business owner and are
interacting with your community, answering questions, and trying to be
involved in your niche online.

Find relevant blogs and answer people's questions, or just make comments on
articles you read.

### Niche relevant forum/community links

Participating in forums is similar to blog comments.

Look for forums in your industry, create a profile (most allow you to put a
link to your website) and then start engaging in meaningful, value-adding
conversations with the users.

These are people who would be your potential customers.

Eventually, after you have built some trust and made some comments, you can
begin to drop a link to a resource on your website that is valuable & relevant
to a forum discussion.

### Guest posts

Guest posting is an SEO term, but really what it is in the ""natural world"" is
when a subject matter expert contributes something to another website.

This is actually very common in industries like health, law, etc. where these
experts will write an opinion piece, research paper, or just give their
contributions to a reporter creating a story and receive credit for their
contribution.

It just happens that in SEO we need that ""credit"" to be in the form of a
[dofollow link](https://devinschumacher.com/do-follow-links/).

Check out our full guide on Guest Posting for more information on how to get
started.

### Link outreach

Link outreach (aka skyscraper outreach) is a process where you identify
quality pieces on content on your website and reach out to other bloggers so
they can link to your content.

It works because you only identify relevant blogs/websites that have already
linked to a very similar piece of content - ideally one that is not as
comprehensive, or valuable as your resource, and let them know that you have
created a piece of content that is even better and they should link to you
instead (or in addition to).

### Competitor's Backlinks

For this step, we are classifying your ""competitors"" as the website that are
ranking on Page 1,2,3 for the keyword terms you want to be ranking for.

This is the beauty of SEO - everyone's cards are on the table so to speak.

Type in a keyword (say ""dentist in los angeles"") and look at who is ranking:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-28_at_5_15_53_pm.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-28_at_5_15_53_pm.png)

Look for the businesses ranking (you can skip directories)

Put those URLs into Ahrefs and check out their backlinks:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/backlinks-from-
competitors.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/backlinks-from-competitors.png)

Voilá!

That's 87 dofollow backlinks your Page 1 ranking competitor has that you can
now look into acquiring for your website.

### PBN Links

PBN (private blog network) links are some of the most powerful links you can
build yourself, if not the most powerful.

Building, managing & using a PBN is a very complex process that we will not
cover in detail in this article, but if after doing all of the aforementioned
backlink building you still need some extra SEO firepower, you should consider
creating a small PBN for yourself to utilize.

Join SERP University if you want some further training on how to effectively
build and use a PBN for SEO.

## Final Thoughts

Backlinking is an art, science & process.

<p>In this article, we will map out every type of backlink that's worth building,
teach you how to build them, and even what order they should be built in for
maximum SEO impact.</p>
<p>Everything we discuss here is practiced daily in our agency and fuels our
website rankings (and our clients' website rankings)</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> : Please read our article on <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/link-building/"">Link
Building</a> before you go through
this. It provides a very clear, conceptual and high-level look at how this all
works from a 30,000-foot bird's eye view.</p>
<p>This guide on backlinks will discuss, in detail, all the different types of
backlinks and how to get them - but without the context of what &amp; why from our
link building article, it may be less clear what you should do.</p>
<h2>What are backlinks?</h2>
<p>Backlinks (aka ""back links"", ""back-links"", ""links"", “inbound links”, etc.) are
hyperlinks that point to your website but come  <em>from</em>  other websites.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/what-
are-backlinks.jpg""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/what-are-
backlinks.jpg"" /></a></p>
<p>When a Website A hyperlinks to Website B, you can say that Website B just
acquired a ""backlink"" from Website A.</p>
<p>Simple enough, right?</p>
<h2>Why Are Backlinks Important?</h2>
<p>Search engines (especially Google) use backlinks as a <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/"">ranking
factor</a>.</p>
<p>Backlinks are analogous to “votes”, ""referrals"", a ""vouch"" or ""recommendation""
about your website and its content.</p>
<p>Very similar real life, when multiple people recommend a movie, or restaurant,
or music artist, you tend to become interested &amp; develop a sense of trust for
that thing. Google works the same way.</p>
<p>The more (quality + relevant) backlinks your website acquires, the higher your
content &amp; keywords will rank, and the more relevant traffic will come to your
website.</p>
<p>It's awesome.</p>
<h2>How to Get Backlinks</h2>
<p>Backlinks fall into <strong>2 main types:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Built</li>
<li>Earned</li>
</ol>
<p>This means that some links you can go out and <em>build</em> yourself. This would
include things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social profile links</li>
<li>Blog comments</li>
<li>Forum signature links</li>
<li>Business directory listings</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other links you have to earn. This would include things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting a link on another bloggers website</li>
<li>Getting a link from a story written in Techcrunch</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although there are only two real types of links, there are <strong>3 ways to get
backlinks.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Build</li>
<li>Earn (Naturally or Un-naturally)</li>
<li>Buy</li>
</ol>
<p>We will try to break up &amp; organize this guide by backlinks you can ""Build"" vs.
backlinks, you must ""Earn"". And, if there is a place to buy them (ex: from a
trusted link building service provider) we will mention that in each link
write-up.</p>
<h3>A quick note on link builders &amp; link building services</h3>
<p>There is a seemingly endless amount of link building service providers on the
internet.</p>
<p>Really, you can find everything from Citations to SAPE if you know where to
look.</p>
<p>Buying links from the wrong person can get you into serious SEO trouble.</p>
<p>Be careful who you get links from.</p>
<p>We only recommend getting links from very trusted providers, and we will never
recommend someone we have not worked with before - at least not without a
gigantic disclaimer.</p>
<p>Make sure you fully trust &amp; vet any person or company before purchasing links
from them.</p>
<h2>What Makes a Link Good?</h2>
<p>There are some properties that make a link good, and knowing how to evaluate
link opportunities is a crucial skill to develop for conducting a successful
SEO campaign.</p>
<p>We cover this in detail in our <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/link-building/"">Link Building Intro
Guide</a>, but it's worth re-capping
a few of the main points here as well.</p>
<p><strong>Things that make backlinks good:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A</strong> uthority</li>
<li><strong>R</strong> elevance</li>
<li><strong>T</strong> raffic</li>
</ul>
<h2>Backlinks to Avoid</h2>
<p>Up to this point, we have talked a lot about back links you should acquire,
which kind to get and how to do it.</p>
<p>But, equally important to the backlinks you GET is the ones to AVOID getting.</p>
<p>The key to mastering this (without having to memorize a bunch of stuff) is to
learn how to identify a ""bad neighborhood"" - and avoid being associated with
it.</p>
<p><strong>In general, you want to avoid getting links from:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Irrelevant websites (unless they are very high DR)</li>
<li>Domains in questionable geographies</li>
<li>Domains that have been hacked/spammed</li>
<li>Domains with toxic or over-optimized anchor text</li>
<li>Public Blog Networks</li>
<li>Software built backlinks</li>
<li>Fiverr</li>
</ul>
<h3>Public Blog Networks</h3>
<p>A public blog network is really just a PBN (private blog network) that isn't
actually private.</p>
<p>Building and maintaining a private blog network is very time consuming,
expensive, technically difficult, and overall just one giant P.I.T.A.</p>
<p>However, if done well and kept secret they are extremely powerful.</p>
<p>The problem is there are many providers that publicly sell links on their
""Private"" Blog Networking - thus making it a ""Public Blog Network"". They
usually don't have your best interests in mind they just want some money for a
link. Do not get these links.</p>
<h3>Software built backlinks</h3>
<p>There are a lot of software is the build backlinks these days. They are cheap,
fast &amp; can build links in huge quantities.</p>
<p>This used to work many years ago, but now it is really just a recipe for
disaster.</p>
<p>Unless you really know what you are doing stay away from using software to
build links.</p>
<h3>Fiverr</h3>
<p>A lot of SEOs go to Fiverr for link building work. Terrible idea.</p>
<p>Although there may be the occasional quality link provider on Fiverr - for the
most part these people are spammers who are trying to make some easy money.
They don't care about you, or your client, or your website or anything other
than selling garbage.</p>
<p>Do you really think this is worth this dude's time to build you 500,000 links
for $5? And do you really think it would be natural for Google to see 500,000
links come to your site all of a sudden?</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

fiverr-1024x541-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>The answer is <strong>Duck No.</strong></p>

<p>Avoid Fiverr for backlinks.</p>
<h3>Evaluating a Potential Backlink Opportunity</h3>
<p>Here is a video talking about a guest post opportunity I was presented with,
but that I ultimately deemed to be a bad idea. In the video, I talk briefly
about some warning signs and walk through my thought process on why it was a
good idea to not pursue this link opportunity.</p>
<h2>How To Build High-Quality Backlinks, In The Proper Order</h2>
<p>Hopefully, by now, you have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of
backlinks:</p>
<ul>
<li>What they are</li>
<li>Why they are important</li>
<li>How to evaluate them</li>
<li>Which ones to avoid</li>
</ul>
<p>If so, then it's time to get building.</p>
<p>We like to build backlinks in a certain order that follows the most natural
progression of backlink types that a website would pick up if they were just
doing what most people do.</p>

<h3>Foundational Social Profiles</h3>
<p>Foundational social profiles are the primary social networking profiles that a
normal business owner would set up and utilize for marketing and social
promotion.</p>
<p>In fact, there are some social profiles that are so commonly used that Google
expects you to have them if you are a real/legitimate business.</p>
<p>They even list them in their guidelines found
<a href=""https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/social-profile"">here</a>.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

<p>Start your backlink building by building business profiles on these
foundational profiles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook Business Page</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Linkedin Business Page</li>
<li>Instagram</li>
<li>YouTube</li>
<li>Pinterest (if visual content is relevant to your industry)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro-tip</strong> : Fully fill-out/complete these profiles with images, videos,

<p>Niche business directories are the web directories that are specific to your
niche, or at least to your broad industry.</p>

<h3>Press Release</h3>
<p>A press release, news release, media release, press statement or video release
is an official statement delivered to members of the news media for the
purpose of providing information, an official statement, or making an
announcement (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_release"">source</a>).</p>
<p>Businesses use press releases every day to make announcements they want the
general public to know about, like opening a new store.</p>
<p>Using a Press Release can be a strategic move for your SEO.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> : You generally want these links to be NOFOLLOW. One of the rare
occasions where you do not want DOFOLLOW links. You also want to keep your
anchor text to either Brand Name or Naked URL.</p>
<h3>Niche relevant blog comments</h3>
<p>Getting blog comments is something natural if you are a business owner and are
interacting with your community, answering questions, and trying to be
involved in your niche online.</p>
<p>Find relevant blogs and answer people's questions, or just make comments on
articles you read.</p>
<h3>Niche relevant forum/community links</h3>
<p>Participating in forums is similar to blog comments.</p>
<p>Look for forums in your industry, create a profile (most allow you to put a
link to your website) and then start engaging in meaningful, value-adding
conversations with the users.</p>
<p>These are people who would be your potential customers.</p>
<p>Eventually, after you have built some trust and made some comments, you can
begin to drop a link to a resource on your website that is valuable &amp; relevant
to a forum discussion.</p>
<h3>Guest posts</h3>
<p>Guest posting is an SEO term, but really what it is in the ""natural world"" is
when a subject matter expert contributes something to another website.</p>
<p>This is actually very common in industries like health, law, etc. where these
experts will write an opinion piece, research paper, or just give their
contributions to a reporter creating a story and receive credit for their
contribution.</p>
<p>It just happens that in SEO we need that ""credit"" to be in the form of a
<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/do-follow-links/"">dofollow link</a>.</p>
<p>Check out our full guide on Guest Posting for more information on how to get
started.</p>
<h3>Link outreach</h3>
<p>Link outreach (aka skyscraper outreach) is a process where you identify
quality pieces on content on your website and reach out to other bloggers so
they can link to your content.</p>
<p>It works because you only identify relevant blogs/websites that have already
linked to a very similar piece of content - ideally one that is not as
comprehensive, or valuable as your resource, and let them know that you have
created a piece of content that is even better and they should link to you
instead (or in addition to).</p>
<h3>Competitor's Backlinks</h3>
<p>For this step, we are classifying your ""competitors"" as the website that are
ranking on Page 1,2,3 for the keyword terms you want to be ranking for.</p>
<p>This is the beauty of SEO - everyone's cards are on the table so to speak.</p>
<p>Type in a keyword (say ""dentist in los angeles"") and look at who is ranking:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-28_at_5_15_53_pm.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-28_at_5_15_53_pm.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Look for the businesses ranking (you can skip directories)</p>
<p>Put those URLs into Ahrefs and check out their backlinks:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/backlinks-from-competitors.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/backlinks-from-
competitors.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Voilá!</p>
<p>That's 87 dofollow backlinks your Page 1 ranking competitor has that you can
now look into acquiring for your website.</p>
<h3>PBN Links</h3>
<p>PBN (private blog network) links are some of the most powerful links you can
build yourself, if not the most powerful.</p>
<p>Building, managing &amp; using a PBN is a very complex process that we will not
cover in detail in this article, but if after doing all of the aforementioned
backlink building you still need some extra SEO firepower, you should consider
creating a small PBN for yourself to utilize.</p>
<p>Join SERP University if you want some further training on how to effectively
build and use a PBN for SEO.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Backlinking is an art, science &amp; process.</p>
<p>Developing a streamlined system for acquiring backlinks in order is going to
get you very far in your SEO journey.</p>

## What Is A Title Tag?

The title tag (aka, ""page title"", ""seo title"", ""meta title"" ""seo meta title"",
etc.) is an HTML element that lets search engines know what a webpage is
about.

Your page title is normally displayed on SERPs in the big blue font. This is
what our homepage looks like:

[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/M8uZa9x6JDCmh0kPUUh5EVeAjR2H3jWZPf0oONf6qLtm5uwThA0ir1z2V5NVJf0JnhJYuWJKY4DFIm-

IlEfx8HCrR5SPhORzv5JM014TOcTaIb4rXtpLYuBuNTCiWKbH-adbevAT)

You can also see it at the top of web browsers.

You can also see the page title on web browser bookmarks and social media
shares.

This is how our homepage title tags look like in HTML:

## What Is The Difference Between Title Tag And H1 Tag?

It's a common misconception that the title tag and the H1 tag are the same
thing.

This is not true—they are two different HTML tags.

The title tag is what is shown on the SERP. It is more important for SEO
purposes.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-10.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-10.png)

The H1 tag is the heading on the actual webpage.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-1-1024x474-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/11/image-1.png)

It's easy to confuse these as the same thing because by default WordPress uses
the Page Title as the H1 on blog posts in almost every theme.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/page-title-in-
wordpress.jpg)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/page-
title-in-wordpress.jpg)

You can view the title tag and H1 tag of any webpage easily—here's how.

 **Right-click ""View page source"" on the webpage.**

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-7-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-7-1.png)

 **The page HTML will come up.**

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-6-1024x320-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/11/image-6.png)

 **Ctrl + F ""Title"" for the title tag.**

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-5-2.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-5-2.png)

 **Ctrl + F "" <h1"" for the H1 tag.**

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-4-2.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-4-2.png)

## Why Are Title Tags Important For SEO?

 **Title tags are important for 2 basic reasons.**

  1. Keyword placement
  2. Organic click-through rate

Firstly, the title tag is one of the most crucial places to put a keyword.

Second, a great page title can entice readers to click-through—it is often the
first thing people see on SERPs. Organic click-through rate is a user
experience signal, and also a [search engine ranking
factor](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/).

Google tracks user experience signals—such as organic click-through
rate—boosting content that performs well.

Therefore, organic click-through-rate affects SEO.

## Best Practice

  * One Primary Keyword + Variations
  * Front-load Your Keyword
  * [Shorter Title Length](http://shorter-title-length)
  * Use Numbers (Odd Not Even)
  * Add Title Modifiers / Superlatives
  * Write For Search Intent (Not Search Queries)

### One Primary Keyword + Variations

The title tag is one of the most important places to feature a keyword. Google
will definitely be looking for one there—[they even recommend
it](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en).

Putting a keyword in your title tags = better results.

Independent research from [Brian Dean ](https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-
factors#pagelevel) supports this.

[![Backlinko Title Tag Study](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/backlinko-title-tag-
study.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/backlinko-
title-tag-study.png)source: backlinko

Keyword in page title = higher SERP ranking.

That said, avoid stuffing too many keywords in there—one primary is enough.
Google has been [very clear regarding
this](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en).

However, our own independent research has shown that adding keyword variations
can help.

Often you will find that webpages don't just rank for a primary keyword, but
several variations.

[This is what Ahrefs discovered](https://ahrefs.com/blog/also-rank-for-
study/). Top pages on SERPs rank high for 1000+ different keyword variations.

[![00 average number also rank for keywords2](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/00-average-number-also-rank-for-
keywords2.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/00-average-number-also-rank-for-keywords2.png)source:
ahrefs

Look to include 1-2 keyword variations in your page titles for maximum SEO
benefit.

 **Takeaway:** One primary keyword + variations.

### Front-load Your Keyword

Front-loading your keyword means to feature a keyword at the start, or towards
the beginning in your title tags.

Like this.

[![Front Loaded Keyword Title Tag](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/front-loaded-keyword-title-
tag.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/front-loaded-
keyword-title-tag.png)source: gotchseo

Why should we do this? Because it appears to improve SERP ranking.

Enter something in Google and notice that generally, the top results have that
search term (keyword) listed earlier in the page titles.

**Here is an example.**

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-24-2.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-24-2.png)

Google seems to put more emphasis on words featured earlier in page titles.

 **Takeaway:** Place keyword at the beginning of title tag or close to it.

### Shorter Title Length

When it comes to title tag length, shorter generally performs better. It's
easier for people to read and easier for Google to understand.

When you provide a superior user experience, and make it easier for Google to
rank your content, you get better results.

[Research from Matthew Barby](https://www.matthewbarby.com/ranking-in-google/)
supports this. Webpages with shorter page title length ranked higher on SERPs.

[![Short Titles](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/short-
titles.jpg)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/short-
titles.jpg)source: matthew barby

[Shorter headlines have also been shown to have higher click-through
rates.](https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2015/08/headlines-tips-tools/)

The better result are not just in the SERPs, either.

[Research from HubSpot](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-social-media-
study) showed 11-14 character headlines get more social media shares.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/blog-post-content-
title-length-social-shares.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/blog-post-content-title-length-social-shares.png)

If your page title is too long, the excess will be cut-off. It'll look like
this.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image14-11.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image14-11.png)

Notice the ...

The cut-off point is around 60 characters [according to
Moz](https://moz.com/learn/seo/title-tag), but this varies depending on what
device is being used.

[Research of over 2600 viral headlines](http://www.ripenn.com/blog/7-things-
marketers-can-learn-from-2616-viral-headlines/) showed that after 62
characters, search engine cut-off the rest.

Ideally you'll want to have a short as possible title length—given you say
what you need to (keywords, modifiers/superlatives, etc..)

 **Takeaway:** Keep title length short—under 60 characters.

### Use Numbers (Odd Not Even)

Having numbers in your title tags can have profound user experience benefits.

It's a psychological thing. The human brain finds numbers easy to
understand—they are specific and measurable.

A study of headline preferences from [Conductor](https://www.conductor.com/)
confirms this. Take a look at this graph.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/blog-post-
headline-study.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/blog-post-headline-study.png)

It's no wonder so many headlines feature numbers. Buzzfeed popularized
numbered headlines—dubbed ""listicles.""

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/buzzfeed-listicle-
blog-posts.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/buzzfeed-listicle-blog-posts.png)

It's also important to note, for some strange reason odd numbers perform
better.

[Hubspot's study of 150,000 headlines](https://offers.hubspot.com/datadriven-
strategies-titles-headlines) showed a 20% higher click-through rate for odd
numbered headlines.

Remember, Google use user experience signals to better rank content. A
headline with an odd number is going to get more clicks—Google will see that
and reward you.

 **Takeaway:** Feature odd numbers in page title for click-through rate boost.

### Add Title Modifiers / Superlatives

Title modifiers are basically phrases that are typically added on to search
queries, such as the year, or ""best."" This is typically done by search users
because they want ultra-specific results.

Here are some examples on SERPs.

Here is a list of some title modifiers you can use.

  * Year
  * Guide
  * Reviews
  * Best
  * Easy
  * Fast
  * Simple
  * Checklist
  * Course
  * Boost

 **So.. Why add title modifiers?**

Because they are a great way to get some extra long-tail keyword traffic. It's
an absolutely fantastic strategy to combine with long-tail keyword variations
in your page title.

[Backlinko's Brian Dean highly recommends](https://backlinko.com/on-page-seo)
the use of title modifiers.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-2.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-2.png)

It's a simple trick to broaden your content to a much wider net of search
queries.

 **Takeaway:** Add title modifiers for long-tail keyword variation boost.

### Write For Search Intent (Not Search Queries)

When creating your page title, it's important that you write it for search
intent, not search query.

Search intent is what someone is really looking for when they use Google.

This does not always exactly match what they enter into the search bar.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-9-2.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-9-2.png)

 **Search intent generally falls under one of these 3 categories.**

  1. **Informational** – Information on something 
  2. **Commercial** – Buying something 
  3. **Navigational** – Directions to somewhere 

There are definitely more categories, but it's best to keep it simple here.

You need to ask yourself... ""What is the purpose of my content? What am I
offering to search users?

When you answer that, you'll know what the put in your title tags.

If you're doing things right your content, keywords and title tags should
match your search intent.

Targeting search intent is important because people will click the SERP result
that best matches what they're looking for.

Google boosts content on SERPs that get more clicks. This is considered a user
experience signal—observations that greatly influence SEO.

**Search intent = Better user experience (click-through rate, bounce rate,
dwell time, pogo-sticking, etc.)**

 **Better user experience = Better SERP results.**

 **Takeaway:** Target search intent for user experience benefits.

<p>Putting a keyword in your title tags = better results.</p>
<p>Independent research from <a href=""https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-
factors#pagelevel"">Brian Dean </a> supports this.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/backlinko-

<p>Keyword in page title = higher SERP ranking.</p>
<p>That said, avoid stuffing too many keywords in there—one primary is enough.
Google has been <a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en"">very clear regarding
this</a>.</p>
<p>However, our own independent research has shown that adding keyword variations
can help.</p>
<p>Often you will find that webpages don't just rank for a primary keyword, but
several variations.</p>
<p><a href=""https://ahrefs.com/blog/also-rank-for-
study/"">This is what Ahrefs discovered</a>. Top pages on SERPs rank high for 1000+ different keyword variations.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/00-average-number-also-rank-for-keywords2.png""><img alt=""00 average number also rank for keywords2"" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/00-average-number-also-rank-for-
keywords2.png"" /></a>source:
ahrefs</p>
<p>Look to include 1-2 keyword variations in your page titles for maximum SEO
benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> One primary keyword + variations.</p>
<h3>Front-load Your Keyword</h3>
<p>Front-loading your keyword means to feature a keyword at the start, or towards
the beginning in your title tags.</p>
<p>Like this.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/front-loaded-
keyword-title-tag.png""><img alt=""Front Loaded Keyword Title Tag"" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/front-loaded-keyword-title-
tag.png"" /></a>source: gotchseo</p>
<p>Why should we do this? Because it appears to improve SERP ranking.</p>
<p>Enter something in Google and notice that generally, the top results have that
search term (keyword) listed earlier in the page titles.</p>
<p><strong>Here is an example.</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-24-2.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-24-2.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Google seems to put more emphasis on words featured earlier in page titles.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Place keyword at the beginning of title tag or close to it.</p>
<h3>Shorter Title Length</h3>
<p>When it comes to title tag length, shorter generally performs better. It's
easier for people to read and easier for Google to understand.</p>
<p>When you provide a superior user experience, and make it easier for Google to
rank your content, you get better results.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.matthewbarby.com/ranking-in-google/"">Research from Matthew Barby</a>
supports this. Webpages with shorter page title length ranked higher on SERPs.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/short-
titles.jpg""><img alt=""Short Titles"" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/short-
titles.jpg"" /></a>source: matthew barby</p>
<p><a href=""https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2015/08/headlines-tips-tools/"">Shorter headlines have also been shown to have higher click-through
rates.</a></p>
<p>The better result are not just in the SERPs, either.</p>
<p><a href=""https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-social-media-
study"">Research from HubSpot</a> showed 11-14 character headlines get more social media shares.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/blog-post-content-title-length-social-shares.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/blog-post-content-
title-length-social-shares.png"" /></a></p>
<p>If your page title is too long, the excess will be cut-off. It'll look like
this.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image14-11.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image14-11.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Notice the ...</p>
<p>The cut-off point is around 60 characters <a href=""https://moz.com/learn/seo/title-tag"">according to
Moz</a>, but this varies depending on what
device is being used.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.ripenn.com/blog/7-things-
marketers-can-learn-from-2616-viral-headlines/"">Research of over 2600 viral headlines</a> showed that after 62
characters, search engine cut-off the rest.</p>
<p>Ideally you'll want to have a short as possible title length—given you say
what you need to (keywords, modifiers/superlatives, etc..)</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Keep title length short—under 60 characters.</p>
<h3>Use Numbers (Odd Not Even)</h3>
<p>Having numbers in your title tags can have profound user experience benefits.</p>
<p>It's a psychological thing. The human brain finds numbers easy to
understand—they are specific and measurable.</p>
<p>A study of headline preferences from <a href=""https://www.conductor.com/"">Conductor</a>
confirms this. Take a look at this graph.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/blog-post-headline-study.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/blog-post-
headline-study.png"" /></a></p>
<p>It's no wonder so many headlines feature numbers. Buzzfeed popularized
numbered headlines—dubbed ""listicles.""</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/buzzfeed-listicle-blog-posts.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/buzzfeed-listicle-
blog-posts.png"" /></a></p>
<p>It's also important to note, for some strange reason odd numbers perform
better.</p>
<p><a href=""https://offers.hubspot.com/datadriven-
strategies-titles-headlines"">Hubspot's study of 150,000 headlines</a> showed a 20% higher click-through rate for odd
numbered headlines.</p>
<p>Remember, Google use user experience signals to better rank content. A
headline with an odd number is going to get more clicks—Google will see that
and reward you.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Feature odd numbers in page title for click-through rate boost.</p>
<h3>Add Title Modifiers / Superlatives</h3>
<p>Title modifiers are basically phrases that are typically added on to search
queries, such as the year, or ""best."" This is typically done by search users
because they want ultra-specific results.</p>
<p>Here are some examples on SERPs.</p>
<p>Here is a list of some title modifiers you can use.</p>
<ul>
<li>Year</li>
<li>Guide</li>
<li>Reviews</li>
<li>Best</li>
<li>Easy</li>
<li>Fast</li>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Checklist</li>
<li>Course</li>
<li>Boost</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So.. Why add title modifiers?</strong></p>
<p>Because they are a great way to get some extra long-tail keyword traffic. It's
an absolutely fantastic strategy to combine with long-tail keyword variations
in your page title.</p>
<p><a href=""https://backlinko.com/on-page-seo"">Backlinko's Brian Dean highly recommends</a>
the use of title modifiers.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-2.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-2.png"" /></a></p>
<p>It's a simple trick to broaden your content to a much wider net of search
queries.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Add title modifiers for long-tail keyword variation boost.</p>
<h3>Write For Search Intent (Not Search Queries)</h3>
<p>When creating your page title, it's important that you write it for search
intent, not search query.</p>
<p>Search intent is what someone is really looking for when they use Google.</p>
<p>This does not always exactly match what they enter into the search bar.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-9-2.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-9-2.png"" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Search intent generally falls under one of these 3 categories.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Informational</strong> – Information on something </li>
<li><strong>Commercial</strong> – Buying something </li>
<li><strong>Navigational</strong> – Directions to somewhere </li>
</ol>
<p>There are definitely more categories, but it's best to keep it simple here.</p>
<p>You need to ask yourself... ""What is the purpose of my content? What am I
offering to search users?</p>
<p>When you answer that, you'll know what the put in your title tags.</p>
<p>If you're doing things right your content, keywords and title tags should
match your search intent.</p>
<p>Targeting search intent is important because people will click the SERP result
that best matches what they're looking for.</p>
<p>Google boosts content on SERPs that get more clicks. This is considered a user
experience signal—observations that greatly influence SEO.</p>
<p><strong>Search intent = Better user experience (click-through rate, bounce rate,
dwell time, pogo-sticking, etc.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Better user experience = Better SERP results.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Target search intent for user experience benefits.</p>

SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/) campaign (and a great boost for
non-local campaigns as well).

Every SEO campaign should start with building a presence online for your
business.

By creating the foundational business directories (Google My Business, Apple
Maps, Bing Places, Yelp, etc.) you begin to tell [search
engines](https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/) that your business is an
actual corporate entity.

Then, when you begin to develop your business presence across more & more
trusted web directories you increase the amount of web visibility for your
business, acquire more backlinks from trusted websites, begin to collect
customer reviews, and establish your business as an ""entity"" in search engines
- something they can understand (and then _recommen_ d).

Think about if Apple never provided the correct signals to search engines that
it was, in fact, a business that sells products - and not a literal apple.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/the-beatles-vs-
apple-computer.jpg)

Getting a handle on your business directories & citations is how you make sure
your business isn't mistaken for a fruit, and in this article, we show you
exactly how to plant that seed properly.

## What is a Local Citation?

A **local citation** (aka ""business citation"" or ""SEO citation"") gets its name
from the broader word ""citation"", for _reference._

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/what-is-a-
citation.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/what-is-
a-citation.png)

In the world of Search Engine Optimization, a citation is a reference to your
business.

Specifically, any mention or appearance of your business's Name, Address &
Phone Number on the web.

**Note** : If the only thing mentioned was your business name, this would be a
brand mention - not a citation.

The primary way to acquire these citations (mentions of your business's Name,
Address, Phone Number) is to make sure you are listed on quality business
directories.

 **An Example of a Local Business Citation:**

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/serp_co_business_citation_example__dexknows_.png)
Notice the Name, Address & Phone Number are all included

## The Importance of Citations for SEO

Business SEO citations ( ** _remember_** _: a mention of your business on
another website_ ) is a way for search engines to ""verify"" your business
information (aka build trust) with 3rd Party information providers.

When Googlebot crawls the web and find your business's information listed with
trusted third-party info providers (like InfoUSA, Dexknows.com,
Yellowpages.com, etc.) it can begin to make the assumption ""well if all these
other trusted info providers all have the same business information listed,
then there is probably a good chance that this business is legitimate & still
active).

The key to SEO is building trust - online and IRL.

Trust online (just like in real life) is built by being transparent & building
a positive reputation with other people (or websites in the case of the
internet) and organizations.

Whether you are building trust with your [on-page
SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/) strategy (providing quality
information, using schema to markup your data, etc.) or your [off-page
SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/off-page-seo/) strategy you want to aim for
**A** uthority, **R** elevance & **T** rust.

Having your business listed on the **A** uthoritative, **R** elevant & **T**
rusted web directories & information providers is a huge step in the right
direction.

Additionally, business directories (the place where you will get most of your
citations) command alot of SERP real estate. So when users search something
and click on one of those directories you want to be sure you're listed on
there and get some of that traffic.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/business-
directories-on-a-serp-650x1024-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/business-directories-on-a-SERP.png)

Not being on these directories would be similar to not being in the phone book
but still expecting people to open it up and call you.

 **SUMMARY:** Business Directories are critically important for your SEO in
that they:

  1. Establish your business as an entity (think apple vs. an apple)
  2. Provide signals of trust from trusted 3rd party websites to your website
  3. Can send real traffic & customers to your website.

 **Takeaway** : Citations are critical if you want to rank highly in local
organic SERPs and in the maps.

### Inaccurate listings? What could possibly go wrong...?

Let's think about this from the flip side for a second.

Imagine you are in your car on the highway, traveling to an interview for your
dream job an hour away, about to run out of fuel - in desperate need of a gas
station. Your tank reads ""15 miles to empty"".

So you pull out your phone & search for a ""gas station"" on maps.

You see there are 2 gas stations near you:

  1. The first one is only 15 miles away, but it's BEHIND you (you already passed it).
  2. The second one is 30 miles away, but it's AHEAD of you (in the right direction that you are heading).

Which one do you want to go to? The one that is within your driving range but
out of the way or the one that is out of your driving range, but on the way to
your destination?

You decide to opt for the safe bet, pull off the highway & start backtracking
a bit to the gas station you already passed only to find out that this gas
station is closed. And now you're stuck.

You have to call roadside assistance because now the other gas station is
really far and you have no gas left.

Will you ever use that search engine's maps feature again?

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-21.gif)

This is the power of business citations. They provide the consumer with
critical information about businesses - and if they are wrong the can create
inconvenient (or even catastrophic) situations.

So, needless to say search engines want to only include accurate business
information in their search engine results.

 **Takeaway** : SEO Citations are a major [search engine ranking
factor](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/) for Local SEO.

## Types of Citations

  * Structured vs. Unstructured
  * General vs. Niche
  * Geographic

### Structured vs. Unstructured

#### Structured Citations

A **structured citation** is a business citation where the information is
neatly presented in a traditional business listing structure. They are
typically found on business directories and other places where you can create
a specific page for your business (ex: Facebook business Pages)

Structured citations are normally created by through:

  1. Submitting your business listing information into structured HTML fields.
  2. Manually writing your business information in an organized format.

##### An example of a structured citation

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-30-at-12.53.56-pm.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2019-10-30-at-12.53.56-pm.png)

#### Unstructured Citations

An **unstructured citation** is a business citation where the necessary
business information is present on a single web page, but not in the
traditional ""structured format"". They are typically found in blog posts,
forums, news articles, etc.

Unstructured citations are created when a business's information is mentioned
in a (usually) more conversational tone.

##### An example of an unstructured citation

A press release about SERP Co with this paragraph in the post:

SERP Co has opened a new location in Los Angeles, CA to provide the city of LA
with world-class digital marketing services. They have experts at the highest
level doing SEO, advertising, and other forms of digital marketing for local
and national businesses. Give them a call at (855) 818-7951 or contact them
through their website at <https://devinschumacher.com/contact>. Or, if you
prefer in-person appointments, you can drop by their office anytime from 9
AM-6 PM at: 1543 Rosalia Rd Unit 206, Los Angeles, CA 90027.

Notice how the Name, Address & Phone Number (NAP) all appear in the paragraph
in an ""unstructured"" manner.

### General vs. Niche

#### General Citations

 **General citations** (aka ""generic"", ""primary"", ""main"") are the standard
business directories that pretty much all businesses need to get listed on.

**Some examples of general directories are:**

  * Yelp
  * Dexknows
  * Yellowpages
  * Citypages
  * Mapquest
  * Foursquare
  * Manta
  * MerchantCircle
  * Citysearch
  * etc.

 **Takeaway** : Get your business listed on the general directories as a
foundation for building your business's  **A** uthority &  **T** rust.

#### Niche Citations

 **Niche citations** (aka ""industry"") are business directories cater to a
specific niche (ie: Dentists) or the broader industry (ie: Health).

You can find niche-specific directories in almost every industry and they are
very good places to get your business listed on.

Niche citations will typically be less authoritative - but the concentrated
relevance of these websites makes up for the lack of authority (DR).

 **Some examples of niche directories are:**

  * Avvo.com (Legal)
  * Justia.com (Legal)
  * Superlawyers.com (Legal)
  * 1800dentist.com (Dental)
  * Dentist.com (Dental)
  * Wellness.com (Health)
  * AngiesList.com (Home Services)
  * Thumbtack.com (Home Services)
  * etc.

 **Takeaway** : Get your business listed on relevant geo-specific directories
as a foundation for building your  **R** elevance.

### Geographic

#### Geo Citations

 **Geo specific citations** are business directories that are dedicated to a
certain geographic area, like a city or state. They are great for building
geographic relevance.

Just like niche citations provide niche or industry level concentrated
relevance to your business, geo citations do the same at the geographic/local
level.

If your business is located in Los Angeles, CA and you have links from
websites like ""businessdirectory **losangeles**.com"" you can see how the
relevance coming from a domain with **los angeles** in it would help you rank
for geo modified keywords, like ""[Los Angeles SEO
Company](https://devinschumacher.com//los-angeles/)"".

The more relevance you can build for your business at the niche & geo level,
the better off you will be in the SERPs for those types of keyword searches.

 **Takeaway** : Get your business listed on relevant geo-specific directories
as a foundation for building your  **R** elevance.

## SEO Citation Properties

### NAP

  * Name
  * Address
  * Phone Number

The most basic way to get a business citation is for your business's Name,
Address & Phone Number (NAP) to present on a webpage.

You want to make sure that everywhere you have a citation that your NAP is
consistent.

Ground zero for your NAP is your Google My Business (GMB) listing - all other
listings need to **match the information & format** of your GMB.

For example, take a look at the NAP on this GMB:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-30-at-4.27.00-pm.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2019-10-30-at-4.27.00-pm.png)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-30_at_4_24_19_pm.png)

This is how our NAP needs to be on all other business directories:

SERP Co - A Los Angeles Digital Marketing Agency  
1543 Rosalia Road  
Unit 206  
Los Angeles, CA 90027  
(855) 818-7951

 **Match the information exactly, and if you can match the format as well** \-
do it. Although this isn't always possible so just do your best in those
cases.

PS - _that now counts as a structured citation._

 **Takeaway** : Keep your NAP consistent across all of your citations.

### Business Details

  * Category(s)
  * Email
  * Hours
  * Cost
  * Menu
  * Payment Types Accepted
  * Reviews

The business details area comes in many forms, but generally includes
information such as your business category, email address, store hours, etc.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/business-
details.png)

#### Best Practice:

  * Fill out all your business details as completely & consistently as possible.

### Links

  * Main URL
  * Scheduling URL
  * Social Media URLs

This is probably the 2nd most important part of getting citations (the first
is getting the citation).

Citations are a great place to get backlinks coming to your website because
the properties you are getting citations from should always be either **A**
uthoritative, **T** rusted, or **R** elevant.

#### Best Practice:

  * Include a link to the most relevant landing page for your address (if you have more than one location it would probably be something like domain.com/location-1).
  * Point the scheduling/appointment URL to your appointments or contact page.
  * Include links to your other primary business directories & social profiles whenever possible.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-30-at-4.38.44-pm.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2019-10-30-at-4.38.44-pm.png)

### Description(s)

  * Business description
  * Service(s) description

Many business directories have a section where you can write a description of
your business.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/business_description_on_a_directory_gmb-1024x940-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/business_description_on_a_directory_GMB.png)

Use [keywords](https://devinschumacher.com/seo-keywords/) (niche and local,
when relevant) and [keyword variations](https://devinschumacher.com/lsi-
keywords/) throughout your content.

### Multimedia

  * Images
  * Videos
  * Tour

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/using-images-and-
multimedia-on-business-directories-and-citations-3-1024x346-1.png)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/using-images-and-
multimedia-on-business-directories-and-citations-1-1024x698-1.png)

Multimedia is a very under-utilized part of business directories.

Whenever possible add (geotagged) images, pictures of your team, exterior
images, interior images, videos, virtual tours, etc. to your business
properties.

Not only will this will provide a better experience for potential customers,
help build a connection and increase trust in your brand - it's good for SEO
too.

The more data Google can ""gobble-up"" of yours, the happier it gets.

Google is basically like the cookie monster of search engines.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-23.gif)

## Citation Quality

  * Quality
  * Consistency
  * X-factor

### Quality

Before you get a citation (or any link for that matter) you want to make sure
you are associating your website with other good websites. This is called
being in a ""good neighborhood"".

Evaluating citations is pretty easy, and we recommend you follow the same
guidelines for evaluating links that we cover in our [link-
building](https://devinschumacher.com/link-building/) & backlink articles.

Essentially, what you want to do is make sure the place you are getting a
citation from has at least 1 of the ART principles - **A** uthority, **R**
elevance, **T** rust.

The more the better, but at least 1.

### Consistency

We have probably beat this part to death by now, but make sure your citations
are consistent across the web - if you aren't sure, CHECK!

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-30-at-4.54.34-pm.png)

Check your citation consistency
[here](https://www.optimizelocation.com/partner/serpco/diagnostic.html).

### X-Factor

  * Reviews
  * Geotagging

#### Reviews

Reviews play a huge role in your local SEO rankings. Why? Because Google loves
it's 3rd party opinions and sees reviews as a way to get an idea about the
quality of your business from people who have done business with you - a more
trustworthy approach than just taking YOUR word for it.

  *  **Quantity** \- Get more reviews. Ask your customers to leave reviews and try to increase your review count.
  *  **Quality** \- hopefully, you provide a great service and customers are happy with your business so the request you get good ones :)

#### Geotags

Geotagging (in SEO) is a practice where you append geographic meta-information
to images to give them additional geo-relevance. Usually, it is in the form of
longitude and latitude coordinates.

Just like how getting links from geo-specific directories helps increase the
local relevance of your business, having your images coded with geographic
metadata helps improve the local relevance of the images, and subsequently the
place where the images are living (aka the directory you upload them to)

You can get geographic meta-information on images by:

  1. Taking pictures with a mobile phone (normally will automatically add geo info to the phone based on your GPS coordinates at the time you take the photo).
  2. Adding it manually using a program like Adobe Bridge, or Apple Preview.
  3. Using a tool like geoimgr.com.

 **Takeaway:** Geotag your images before you upload them to directories for a
little extra SEO push

## An Introduction to Data Aggregators

Data aggregators are large data-gathering companies that find, distribute and
clean consumer and business information around the web.

They are databases that collect your business's business name, address, and
phone number (NAP) data and distribute it to search engines, marketing
companies, publishers and media websites.

If you've ever received an unsolicited piece of (spam) marketing in your
mailbox, a call from a telemarketer, or random piece of junk mail in your
email box, chances are the company sending you this stuff got your information
from a data aggregator.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-22.gif)

Much of the internet is public and open to web crawlers that scan websites and
catalog data.

Search engines get data from these aggregators and use it as a 3rd party
source to compare & verify business data.

As far as we are concerned (as it relates to SEO there are **4 main data
aggregators:**

  1. Acxiom
  2. Infogroup
  3. Factual
  4. Localeze

You can submit your business data to these data aggregators (and begin to
establish an online presence for your business online) or you can use a
citation building service.

Business directories (websites where you can get a citation, aka get your
business listed) get their information from these aggregators. The directory
websites themselves do not (normally) go around the web scraping info - they
just tap into the aggregators for that info.

A citation building service will go to the Data aggregators and submit all
your information for you. Some go to the individual business directories to
create profiles as well - since not all business directories connect into the
data aggregators (like the smaller ones).

## How to Get Citations

  * Aggregators
  * Services
  * Manual

### Aggregators

We just talked about this above - you can go to the data aggregators yourself,
or have someone do it for you.

Our recommendation is to first [check your current business
listings](https://www.optimizelocation.com/partner/serpco/diagnostic.html)
(for accuracy, completeness & presence), and then decide what to do from
there.

We like using an all-in-one solution to manage business information and sync
to the data aggregators, like Yext.

### Services

After you have submitted your data to aggregators, you will want to identify
and build more citations for your business.

Data aggregators will help get your business listed on a lot of the ""general
directories"" but probably will miss most of your niche & geo-specific
opportunities.

The automated/done-for-you/hands-off way of doing this is by hiring a citation
building service provider to do it for you. Just be careful.

 **CAUTION** : Just like we said in our [link
building](https://devinschumacher.com/link-building/) &
[backlinks](https://devinschumacher.com/backlinks/) articles, hiring people to
build links for you can get you into serious SEO trouble if you hire the wrong
person - so make sure you can trust the reputation, capability & knowledge of
the person or service building your links.

We have tested **A LOT** of citation providers and no one does citation
building to our standards. For this reason, we do it all in house and do not
recommend any providers.

**So what are your options?**

  * [Contact us](https://devinschumacher.com/contact/) if you want our team to do it for you.
  * Follow the citation building training in [SERP University](http://serp.university) and do it yourself.

### Manual

If you don't want to pay someone to find & build your citations for you that's
understandable.

You can do it yourself!

 **Here are the steps:**

  1. Make a list of business directories

## How to Fix & Clean Citations

Fixing (aka ""cleaning"") your citations can be incredibly difficult.

If your business has been around a while there is a very high likelihood you
have citation consistency problems.

Maybe you changed a phone number or were using tracking numbers. Maybe your
address changed, or something in your business name was edited. These things
happen all the time and staying on top of them is critical for your citation
success.

## There are 3 main ways to fix/clean citations:

  1. Log in to the business listing and fix it manually
  2. Submit a change of business information to the directory
  3. Have a service do it for you

#### 1\. Log in to the business listing and fix it manually

Most business directories have a login/pw to access your personal business
profile. Like Yelp, Facebook, etc - you have to sign up with an email and only
you have access to your profile.

If you have your login information, simply go into your profile and make the
necessary edits.

#### 2\. Submit a change of business information to the directory

If you don't have logins to the site, or the directory doesn't function like
that, you may have the ability to submit a change of information.

If this is the case you will need to submit the change, and then make a note
to check the directory in a week or two to see if the changes were pushed
live.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/submit_a_change_of_business_information_to_a_citation_directory.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/submit_a_change_of_business_information_to_a_citation_directory.png)

#### 3\. Have a service do it for you

There are a lot of tools that help you identify citation problems by scanning
well-known business directories for your information and comparing them side
by side for inaccuracies.

These tools are good in that they tell you the errors - but they fall short in
the cleanup. These tools do not know your logins, and so most of them cannot
access the profile to clean it up.

There are a few services that have API connections with data aggregators and
many of the well-known business directories and actually can re-submit your
business information to be cleaned.

The most well known is Yext.

We use Yext to clean citations for our properties and our clients. The
downside is that it's pretty expensive though, so unless you are an agency
doing this in high volume you'd be better off just contacting us to do it for
you.

## Final Thoughts

Citations are a huge part of Local SEO. They are the foundation of getting
ranked highly in Google Maps and being a top choice for potential customers.

Make sure your citations are clean & consistent before you move on to the next

<h2>What is a Local Citation?</h2>
<p>A <strong>local citation</strong> (aka ""business citation"" or ""SEO citation"") gets its name
from the broader word ""citation"", for <em>reference.</em></p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/what-is-
a-citation.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/what-is-a-
citation.png"" /></a></p>
<p>In the world of Search Engine Optimization, a citation is a reference to your
business.</p>
<p>Specifically, any mention or appearance of your business's Name, Address &amp;
Phone Number on the web.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> : If the only thing mentioned was your business name, this would be a
brand mention - not a citation.</p>
<p>The primary way to acquire these citations (mentions of your business's Name,
Address, Phone Number) is to make sure you are listed on quality business
directories.</p>
<p><strong>An Example of a Local Business Citation:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/serp_co_business_citation_example__dexknows_.png"" />
Notice the Name, Address &amp; Phone Number are all included</p>
<h2>The Importance of Citations for SEO</h2>
<p>Business SEO citations ( ** <em>remember</em>** <em>: a mention of your business on
another website</em> ) is a way for search engines to ""verify"" your business
information (aka build trust) with 3rd Party information providers.</p>
<p>When Googlebot crawls the web and find your business's information listed with
trusted third-party info providers (like InfoUSA, Dexknows.com,
Yellowpages.com, etc.) it can begin to make the assumption ""well if all these
other trusted info providers all have the same business information listed,
then there is probably a good chance that this business is legitimate &amp; still
active).</p>
<p>The key to SEO is building trust - online and IRL.</p>
<p>Trust online (just like in real life) is built by being transparent &amp; building
a positive reputation with other people (or websites in the case of the
internet) and organizations.</p>
<p>Whether you are building trust with your <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/"">on-page
SEO</a> strategy (providing quality
information, using schema to markup your data, etc.) or your <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/off-page-seo/"">off-page
SEO</a> strategy you want to aim for
<strong>A</strong> uthority, <strong>R</strong> elevance &amp; <strong>T</strong> rust.</p>
<p>Having your business listed on the <strong>A</strong> uthoritative, <strong>R</strong> elevant &amp; <strong>T</strong>
rusted web directories &amp; information providers is a huge step in the right
direction.</p>
<p>Additionally, business directories (the place where you will get most of your
citations) command alot of SERP real estate. So when users search something
and click on one of those directories you want to be sure you're listed on
there and get some of that traffic.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/business-directories-on-a-SERP.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/business-
directories-on-a-serp-650x1024-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Not being on these directories would be similar to not being in the phone book
but still expecting people to open it up and call you.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> Business Directories are critically important for your SEO in
that they:</p>
<ol>
<li>Establish your business as an entity (think apple vs. an apple)</li>
<li>Provide signals of trust from trusted 3rd party websites to your website</li>
<li>Can send real traffic &amp; customers to your website.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Takeaway</strong> : Citations are critical if you want to rank highly in local
organic SERPs and in the maps.</p>
<h3>Inaccurate listings? What could possibly go wrong...?</h3>
<p>Let's think about this from the flip side for a second.</p>
<p>Imagine you are in your car on the highway, traveling to an interview for your
dream job an hour away, about to run out of fuel - in desperate need of a gas
station. Your tank reads ""15 miles to empty"".</p>
<p>So you pull out your phone &amp; search for a ""gas station"" on maps.</p>
<p>You see there are 2 gas stations near you:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first one is only 15 miles away, but it's BEHIND you (you already passed it).</li>
<li>The second one is 30 miles away, but it's AHEAD of you (in the right direction that you are heading).</li>
</ol>
<p>Which one do you want to go to? The one that is within your driving range but
out of the way or the one that is out of your driving range, but on the way to
your destination?</p>
<p>You decide to opt for the safe bet, pull off the highway &amp; start backtracking
a bit to the gas station you already passed only to find out that this gas
station is closed. And now you're stuck.</p>
<p>You have to call roadside assistance because now the other gas station is
really far and you have no gas left.</p>
<p>Will you ever use that search engine's maps feature again?</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-21.gif"" /></p>
<p>This is the power of business citations. They provide the consumer with
critical information about businesses - and if they are wrong the can create
inconvenient (or even catastrophic) situations.</p>
<p>So, needless to say search engines want to only include accurate business
information in their search engine results.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway</strong> : SEO Citations are a major <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/"">search engine ranking
factor</a> for Local SEO.</p>
<h2>Types of Citations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Structured vs. Unstructured</li>
<li>General vs. Niche</li>
<li>Geographic</li>
</ul>
<h3>Structured vs. Unstructured</h3>
<h4>Structured Citations</h4>
<p>A <strong>structured citation</strong> is a business citation where the information is
neatly presented in a traditional business listing structure. They are
typically found on business directories and other places where you can create
a specific page for your business (ex: Facebook business Pages)</p>
<p>Structured citations are normally created by through:</p>
<ol>
<li>Submitting your business listing information into structured HTML fields.</li>
<li>Manually writing your business information in an organized format.</li>
</ol>
<h5>An example of a structured citation</h5>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2019-10-30-at-12.53.56-pm.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-30-at-12.53.56-pm.png"" /></a></p>
<h4>Unstructured Citations</h4>
<p>An <strong>unstructured citation</strong> is a business citation where the necessary
business information is present on a single web page, but not in the
traditional ""structured format"". They are typically found in blog posts,
forums, news articles, etc.</p>
<p>Unstructured citations are created when a business's information is mentioned
in a (usually) more conversational tone.</p>
<h5>An example of an unstructured citation</h5>
<p>A press release about SERP Co with this paragraph in the post:</p>

with world-class digital marketing services. They have experts at the highest
level doing SEO, advertising, and other forms of digital marketing for local

AM-6 PM at: 1543 Rosalia Rd Unit 206, Los Angeles, CA 90027.</p>
<p>Notice how the Name, Address &amp; Phone Number (NAP) all appear in the paragraph
in an ""unstructured"" manner.</p>
<h3>General vs. Niche</h3>
<h4>General Citations</h4>
<p><strong>General citations</strong> (aka ""generic"", ""primary"", ""main"") are the standard
business directories that pretty much all businesses need to get listed on.</p>
<p><strong>Some examples of general directories are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yelp</li>
<li>Dexknows</li>
<li>Yellowpages</li>
<li>Citypages</li>
<li>Mapquest</li>
<li>Foursquare</li>
<li>Manta</li>
<li>MerchantCircle</li>
<li>Citysearch</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Takeaway</strong> : Get your business listed on the general directories as a
foundation for building your business's  <strong>A</strong> uthority &amp;  <strong>T</strong> rust.</p>
<h4>Niche Citations</h4>
<p><strong>Niche citations</strong> (aka ""industry"") are business directories cater to a
specific niche (ie: Dentists) or the broader industry (ie: Health).</p>
<p>You can find niche-specific directories in almost every industry and they are
very good places to get your business listed on.</p>
<p>Niche citations will typically be less authoritative - but the concentrated
relevance of these websites makes up for the lack of authority (DR).</p>
<p><strong>Some examples of niche directories are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avvo.com (Legal)</li>
<li>Justia.com (Legal)</li>
<li>Superlawyers.com (Legal)</li>
<li>1800dentist.com (Dental)</li>
<li>Dentist.com (Dental)</li>
<li>Wellness.com (Health)</li>
<li>AngiesList.com (Home Services)</li>
<li>Thumbtack.com (Home Services)</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Takeaway</strong> : Get your business listed on relevant geo-specific directories
as a foundation for building your  <strong>R</strong> elevance.</p>
<h3>Geographic</h3>
<h4>Geo Citations</h4>
<p><strong>Geo specific citations</strong> are business directories that are dedicated to a
certain geographic area, like a city or state. They are great for building
geographic relevance.</p>
<p>Just like niche citations provide niche or industry level concentrated
relevance to your business, geo citations do the same at the geographic/local
level.</p>
<p>If your business is located in Los Angeles, CA and you have links from
websites like ""businessdirectory <strong>losangeles</strong>.com"" you can see how the
relevance coming from a domain with <strong>los angeles</strong> in it would help you rank
for geo modified keywords, like ""<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com//los-angeles/"">Los Angeles SEO
Company</a>"".</p>
<p>The more relevance you can build for your business at the niche &amp; geo level,
the better off you will be in the SERPs for those types of keyword searches.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway</strong> : Get your business listed on relevant geo-specific directories
as a foundation for building your  <strong>R</strong> elevance.</p>
<h2>SEO Citation Properties</h2>
<h3>NAP</h3>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Phone Number</li>
</ul>
<p>The most basic way to get a business citation is for your business's Name,
Address &amp; Phone Number (NAP) to present on a webpage.</p>
<p>You want to make sure that everywhere you have a citation that your NAP is
consistent.</p>
<p>Ground zero for your NAP is your Google My Business (GMB) listing - all other
listings need to <strong>match the information &amp; format</strong> of your GMB.</p>
<p>For example, take a look at the NAP on this GMB:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2019-10-30-at-4.27.00-pm.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-30-at-4.27.00-pm.png"" /></a></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen_shot_2019-10-30_at_4_24_19_pm.png"" /></p>
<p>This is how our NAP needs to be on all other business directories:</p>
<p>SERP Co - A Los Angeles Digital Marketing Agency<br />
1543 Rosalia Road<br />
Unit 206<br />
Los Angeles, CA 90027<br />
(855) 818-7951</p>
<p><strong>Match the information exactly, and if you can match the format as well</strong> -
do it. Although this isn't always possible so just do your best in those
cases.</p>
<p>PS - <em>that now counts as a structured citation.</em></p>
<p><strong>Takeaway</strong> : Keep your NAP consistent across all of your citations.</p>
<h3>Business Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>Category(s)</li>
<li>Email</li>
<li>Hours</li>
<li>Cost</li>
<li>Menu</li>
<li>Payment Types Accepted</li>
<li>Reviews</li>
</ul>
<p>The business details area comes in many forms, but generally includes
information such as your business category, email address, store hours, etc.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/business-
details.png"" /></p>
<h4>Best Practice:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fill out all your business details as completely &amp; consistently as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Links</h3>
<ul>
<li>Main URL</li>
<li>Scheduling URL</li>
<li>Social Media URLs</li>
</ul>
<p>This is probably the 2nd most important part of getting citations (the first
is getting the citation).</p>
<p>Citations are a great place to get backlinks coming to your website because
the properties you are getting citations from should always be either <strong>A</strong>
uthoritative, <strong>T</strong> rusted, or <strong>R</strong> elevant.</p>
<h4>Best Practice:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Include a link to the most relevant landing page for your address (if you have more than one location it would probably be something like domain.com/location-1).</li>
<li>Point the scheduling/appointment URL to your appointments or contact page.</li>
<li>Include links to your other primary business directories &amp; social profiles whenever possible.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

shot-2019-10-30-at-4.38.44-pm.png"" /></a></p>
<h3>Description(s)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Business description</li>
<li>Service(s) description</li>
</ul>
<p>Many business directories have a section where you can write a description of
your business.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/10/business_description_on_a_directory_GMB.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/business_description_on_a_directory_gmb-1024x940-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Use <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/seo-keywords/"">keywords</a> (niche and local,
when relevant) and <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/lsi-
keywords/"">keyword variations</a> throughout your content.</p>
<h3>Multimedia</h3>
<ul>
<li>Images</li>
<li>Videos</li>
<li>Tour</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/using-images-and-

multimedia-on-business-directories-and-citations-1-1024x698-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Multimedia is a very under-utilized part of business directories.</p>
<p>Whenever possible add (geotagged) images, pictures of your team, exterior
images, interior images, videos, virtual tours, etc. to your business
properties.</p>
<p>Not only will this will provide a better experience for potential customers,
help build a connection and increase trust in your brand - it's good for SEO
too.</p>
<p>The more data Google can ""gobble-up"" of yours, the happier it gets.</p>
<p>Google is basically like the cookie monster of search engines.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-23.gif"" /></p>
<h2>Citation Quality</h2>
<ul>
<li>Quality</li>
<li>Consistency</li>
<li>X-factor</li>
</ul>
<h3>Quality</h3>
<p>Before you get a citation (or any link for that matter) you want to make sure
you are associating your website with other good websites. This is called
being in a ""good neighborhood"".</p>
<p>Evaluating citations is pretty easy, and we recommend you follow the same
guidelines for evaluating links that we cover in our <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/link-building/"">link-
building</a> &amp; backlink articles.</p>
<p>Essentially, what you want to do is make sure the place you are getting a
citation from has at least 1 of the ART principles - <strong>A</strong> uthority, <strong>R</strong>
elevance, <strong>T</strong> rust.</p>
<p>The more the better, but at least 1.</p>
<h3>Consistency</h3>
<p>We have probably beat this part to death by now, but make sure your citations
are consistent across the web - if you aren't sure, CHECK!</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-10-30-at-4.54.34-pm.png"" /></p>
<p>Check your citation consistency

<h3>X-Factor</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reviews</li>
<li>Geotagging</li>
</ul>
<h4>Reviews</h4>
<p>Reviews play a huge role in your local SEO rankings. Why? Because Google loves
it's 3rd party opinions and sees reviews as a way to get an idea about the
quality of your business from people who have done business with you - a more
trustworthy approach than just taking YOUR word for it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quantity</strong> - Get more reviews. Ask your customers to leave reviews and try to increase your review count.</li>
<li><strong>Quality</strong> - hopefully, you provide a great service and customers are happy with your business so the request you get good ones :)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Geotags</h4>
<p>Geotagging (in SEO) is a practice where you append geographic meta-information
to images to give them additional geo-relevance. Usually, it is in the form of
longitude and latitude coordinates.</p>
<p>Just like how getting links from geo-specific directories helps increase the
local relevance of your business, having your images coded with geographic
metadata helps improve the local relevance of the images, and subsequently the
place where the images are living (aka the directory you upload them to)</p>
<p>You can get geographic meta-information on images by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Taking pictures with a mobile phone (normally will automatically add geo info to the phone based on your GPS coordinates at the time you take the photo).</li>
<li>Adding it manually using a program like Adobe Bridge, or Apple Preview.</li>
<li>Using a tool like geoimgr.com.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Geotag your images before you upload them to directories for a
little extra SEO push</p>
<h2>An Introduction to Data Aggregators</h2>
<p>Data aggregators are large data-gathering companies that find, distribute and
clean consumer and business information around the web.</p>
<p>They are databases that collect your business's business name, address, and
phone number (NAP) data and distribute it to search engines, marketing
companies, publishers and media websites.</p>
<p>If you've ever received an unsolicited piece of (spam) marketing in your
mailbox, a call from a telemarketer, or random piece of junk mail in your
email box, chances are the company sending you this stuff got your information
from a data aggregator.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-22.gif"" /></p>
<p>Much of the internet is public and open to web crawlers that scan websites and
catalog data.</p>
<p>Search engines get data from these aggregators and use it as a 3rd party
source to compare &amp; verify business data.</p>
<p>As far as we are concerned (as it relates to SEO there are <strong>4 main data
aggregators:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Acxiom</li>
<li>Infogroup</li>
<li>Factual</li>
<li>Localeze</li>
</ol>
<p>You can submit your business data to these data aggregators (and begin to
establish an online presence for your business online) or you can use a
citation building service.</p>
<p>Business directories (websites where you can get a citation, aka get your
business listed) get their information from these aggregators. The directory
websites themselves do not (normally) go around the web scraping info - they
just tap into the aggregators for that info.</p>
<p>A citation building service will go to the Data aggregators and submit all
your information for you. Some go to the individual business directories to
create profiles as well - since not all business directories connect into the
data aggregators (like the smaller ones).</p>
<h2>How to Get Citations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Aggregators</li>
<li>Services</li>
<li>Manual</li>
</ul>
<h3>Aggregators</h3>
<p>We just talked about this above - you can go to the data aggregators yourself,
or have someone do it for you.</p>
<p>Our recommendation is to first <a href=""https://www.optimizelocation.com/partner/serpco/diagnostic.html"">check your current business
listings</a>
(for accuracy, completeness &amp; presence), and then decide what to do from
there.</p>
<p>We like using an all-in-one solution to manage business information and sync
to the data aggregators, like Yext.</p>
<h3>Services</h3>
<p>After you have submitted your data to aggregators, you will want to identify
and build more citations for your business.</p>
<p>Data aggregators will help get your business listed on a lot of the ""general
directories"" but probably will miss most of your niche &amp; geo-specific
opportunities.</p>
<p>The automated/done-for-you/hands-off way of doing this is by hiring a citation
building service provider to do it for you. Just be careful.</p>
<p><strong>CAUTION</strong> : Just like we said in our <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/link-building/"">link
building</a> &amp;
<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/backlinks/"">backlinks</a> articles, hiring people to
build links for you can get you into serious SEO trouble if you hire the wrong
person - so make sure you can trust the reputation, capability &amp; knowledge of
the person or service building your links.</p>
<p>We have tested <strong>A LOT</strong> of citation providers and no one does citation
building to our standards. For this reason, we do it all in house and do not
recommend any providers.</p>
<p><strong>So what are your options?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/contact/"">Contact us</a> if you want our team to do it for you.</li>
<li>Follow the citation building training in <a href=""http://serp.university"">SERP University</a> and do it yourself.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Manual</h3>
<p>If you don't want to pay someone to find &amp; build your citations for you that's
understandable.</p>
<p>You can do it yourself!</p>
<p><strong>Here are the steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Make a list of business directories</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to Fix &amp; Clean Citations</h2>
<p>Fixing (aka ""cleaning"") your citations can be incredibly difficult.</p>
<p>If your business has been around a while there is a very high likelihood you
have citation consistency problems.</p>
<p>Maybe you changed a phone number or were using tracking numbers. Maybe your
address changed, or something in your business name was edited. These things
happen all the time and staying on top of them is critical for your citation
success.</p>
<h2>There are 3 main ways to fix/clean citations:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Log in to the business listing and fix it manually</li>
<li>Submit a change of business information to the directory</li>
<li>Have a service do it for you</li>
</ol>
<h4>1. Log in to the business listing and fix it manually</h4>
<p>Most business directories have a login/pw to access your personal business
profile. Like Yelp, Facebook, etc - you have to sign up with an email and only
you have access to your profile.</p>
<p>If you have your login information, simply go into your profile and make the
necessary edits.</p>
<h4>2. Submit a change of business information to the directory</h4>
<p>If you don't have logins to the site, or the directory doesn't function like
that, you may have the ability to submit a change of information.</p>
<p>If this is the case you will need to submit the change, and then make a note
to check the directory in a week or two to see if the changes were pushed
live.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/submit_a_change_of_business_information_to_a_citation_directory.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/submit_a_change_of_business_information_to_a_citation_directory.png"" /></a></p>
<h4>3. Have a service do it for you</h4>
<p>There are a lot of tools that help you identify citation problems by scanning
well-known business directories for your information and comparing them side
by side for inaccuracies.</p>
<p>These tools are good in that they tell you the errors - but they fall short in
the cleanup. These tools do not know your logins, and so most of them cannot
access the profile to clean it up.</p>
<p>There are a few services that have API connections with data aggregators and
many of the well-known business directories and actually can re-submit your
business information to be cleaned.</p>
<p>The most well known is Yext.</p>
<p>We use Yext to clean citations for our properties and our clients. The
downside is that it's pretty expensive though, so unless you are an agency
doing this in high volume you'd be better off just contacting us to do it for
you.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Citations are a huge part of Local SEO. They are the foundation of getting
ranked highly in Google Maps and being a top choice for potential customers.</p>
<p>Make sure your citations are clean &amp; consistent before you move on to the next
step in your SEO campaign.</p>

 **HTML**  (HyperText Markup Language) is one of the basic coding languages
used to create websites and individual webpages. HTML is the language used to
create web pages for display in web browsers.

HTML along with the other coding languages make up your web source code — the
technical back-end of your website.

Here's what it looks like:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/crop-0-0-936-624-0-image.png)

You can see the HTML of any website or individual webpage — here's how.

Right click **""View page source.""**

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-1-1024x490-1.png)

The HTML of that individual webpage should come up.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-2-1024x525-1.png)

## Why Is HTML Important For SEO?

Search engines — like Google — use HTML to better crawl, index and rank
webpages. HTML helps to tell them (the search engines) what a particular
webpage is about.

There are a number of different HTML tags that influence SEO — these will be
covered below.

The more context you can give search engines about your webpage, the better
your SEO results will be.

## SEO HTML Elements

  * Page Titles (Title Tags)
  * Meta Description
  * Image Alt-Text
  * Image Title
  * Image Filename
  * Geotagging
  * Structured Data (SERP Features)
  * Keyword Density

### Page Titles (Title Tags)

The page title (or title tag) is the most important HTML tag for SEO — it is
the search engine equivalent of your page header.

Here's how it looks on the SERPs (search engine results page.)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-4-1.png)

It tells search engines exactly what your individual webpage is about, just
like the headline would for an article.

The page title also appears on internet browser tabs.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-5-1.png)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-7-1024x551-1.png)

The page title is shown if the webpage is shared on social media too.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-9-1.png)source: semrush

The page title is also referred to as the title tags because the actual HTML
tags are **< title> ... </title>**.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-1.png)

To find the title tags in the HTML, search **Ctrl + F "" <title>""**

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-10-1024x353-1.png)

Tags](https://devinschumacher.com/title-tags/).

### Meta Description

The meta description is the short little blurb under the page title on SERPs.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11-2.png)

It is like the summarizing subheading of an article under the headline.

[The meta description isn't a ranking
factor](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/09/google-does-not-
use-keywords-meta-tag.html) — it doesn't directly affect SEO.

Google (and other search engines) don't look at the meta description. There's
no need to put a keyword there.

The meta description can influence click-through rate — a powerful [user
signal](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/#user-signal-
ranking-factors) that affects SEO.

So in a way... A meta description does impact SEO, just not directly.

Compare these two search results with different meta descriptions.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-12-1.png)

Which one would you be more inclined to click?

Exactly.

The meta description acts as a short preview of a webpage — it entices and
persuades people to click through. It's a followup on the page title, it's
like the blurb on the back cover of a book.

### Image Alt-Text

The image alt-text — also known as the alt attribute — is a HTML tag that
tells search engines what an image is.

Look at this example.

The image.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-17-2.png)

The alt-text.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-16-1.png)

[Straight from Google's
mouth](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/114016?hl=en), the image
alt-text is ""text that describes an image."" They even layout examples of best
practice.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-18-1.png)

The alt-text is basically a long-tail keyword for images. It gives search
engines more context to help crawl, index and rank webpages.

It also helps visually impaired people and those with poor internet quality to
understand images.

You can view the alt-text of any image — here's how.

Right click **""Inspect.""**

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-14-2.png)

The image HTML should come up, highlighted on the side of the browser — look
for **alt="" ... ""**

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-15-1.png)

**Related Reading** : Check out our full article on Image Alt-Text.

### Image Title

The image title is like the image equivalent of the meta description — it has
no impact on SEO.

It helps provide additional image information in a user experience sense...
You know that little text pop-up that comes up when you put the cursor on an
image?

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-20.png)

That's the image title.

Because search engines (such as Google) don't look at the image title, it
isn't as important as the alt-text or the filename.

You can find the image title the same way as alt-text — look for **title="" ...
""**

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-21-1.png)

You will find that often, the image title and image alt-text are exactly the
same.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-22-1.png)

This is because the best way to describe an image for search engines (alt-
text) is the best for user experience (image title.)

### Image Filename

The image filename is pretty straightforward — it is the unique name given to
an image when saved, created or edited.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-23-1.png)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-24-1.png)

It does impact SEO — where the alt-text is like a long-tail keyword, the
filename is a short-tail keyword.

The image filename will be accompanied with a unique file format — like JPEG.

 **Here is a list of common file formats.**

  * JPEG — most common file type, useful for all sizes and minimizes file size
  * PNG — used for images that want a transparent background 
  * WebP — for high quality images with low file sizes
  * SVG — used for logos, icons and really small images

The image filename is a little trickier to find when looking at the image HTML
— it'll be in the img src tag.

Look for the file format.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-25-1.png)

### Geotagging

Geotagging is the process of adding a geographical location to a webpage or
specific content on that webpage.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-27-1.png)

 **Some of those specific webpage content/assets that you can geotag
include:**

  * Images
  * Videos
  * RSS Feeds
  * QR Codes

When you geotag something, you are giving search engines (like Google) very
specific, exact geographical information.

This is very powerful for local related search queries — helping you get on
the 1st page of Google.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-28-2.png)

With the advancement of search engine algorithms, geotagging has become less
important.

### Structured Data (SERP Features)

Structured data are special HTML tags that you can add to your webpage.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-30-2.png)

These tags make it easier for search engines to crawl, rank and index.

It's like giving search engines — such as Google — a manual to your webpage.

The more information and context you can give search engines, the better your
SEO efforts will be.

The biggest benefit of structured data is having your webpages/website shown
as SERP features.

SERP features are the different, larger and more detailed results you see at
the top and side of SERPs.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-29-1024x629-1.png)

They make your search results look more enticing — it's basically better
advertising — it enhances click-through rate (user signal.)

 **There are 4 main types of SERP features.**

  * Paid Results
  * Rich Snippets
  * Universal Results
  * Knowledge Graphs

Paid results are the paid Google Adwords and shopping results you see on
SERPs.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-31-2.png)

Rich snippets are small additions to regular search results — such as ratings
or site-links.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-32.png)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-33-1.png)

Universal results are a variety of different things — including the ""People
also ask"" box, image packs and news boxes.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-34-1024x403-1.png)

Knowledge graphs are rather large, intrusive SERP features that take a lot of
attention away from regular search results.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-35-1.png)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-36-1024x218-1.png)

### Keyword Density

Keyword density is how often a keyword is used on an individual webpage.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-37.png)

It's the frequency, not the total volume.

Here's an equation to help you understand.

 **Keyword density = # of times keyword used ÷ total number of words**

If I wrote 100 words and used my keyword once, the density would be 1%.

Keyword density used to be very important for SEO — that was until search
engine algorithms became smarter.

Now, an unnaturally high keyword density (keyword stuffing) will negatively
impact your SEO.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-38-1.png)

Still, keyword density is relevant today — keywords will always be.

The best practice for SEO has just changed.

## Final Thoughts

When it comes to learning the basics of SEO, the first step is usually
covering the HTML tags.

This is because they are the most essential element — can you imagine not
having a page title?

Good luck getting website hits.

<p><strong>HTML</strong>  (HyperText Markup Language) is one of the basic coding languages
used to create websites and individual webpages. HTML is the language used to
create web pages for display in web browsers.</p>
<p>HTML along with the other coding languages make up your web source code — the
technical back-end of your website.</p>
<p>Here's what it looks like:</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/crop-0-0-936-624-0-image.png"" /></p>
<p>You can see the HTML of any website or individual webpage — here's how.</p>
<p>Right click <strong>""View page source.""</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-1-1024x490-1.png"" /></p>
<p>The HTML of that individual webpage should come up.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-2-1024x525-1.png"" /></p>
<h2>Why Is HTML Important For SEO?</h2>
<p>Search engines — like Google — use HTML to better crawl, index and rank
webpages. HTML helps to tell them (the search engines) what a particular
webpage is about.</p>
<p>There are a number of different HTML tags that influence SEO — these will be
covered below.</p>
<p>The more context you can give search engines about your webpage, the better
your SEO results will be.</p>
<h2>SEO HTML Elements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Page Titles (Title Tags)</li>
<li>Meta Description</li>
<li>Image Alt-Text</li>
<li>Image Title</li>
<li>Image Filename</li>
<li>Geotagging</li>
<li>Structured Data (SERP Features)</li>
<li>Keyword Density</li>
</ul>
<h3>Page Titles (Title Tags)</h3>
<p>The page title (or title tag) is the most important HTML tag for SEO — it is
the search engine equivalent of your page header.</p>
<p>Here's how it looks on the SERPs (search engine results page.)</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-4-1.png"" /></p>
<p>It tells search engines exactly what your individual webpage is about, just
like the headline would for an article.</p>
<p>The page title also appears on internet browser tabs.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-5-1.png"" /></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-7-1024x551-1.png"" /></p>
<p>The page title is shown if the webpage is shared on social media too.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-9-1.png"" />source: semrush</p>
<p>The page title is also referred to as the title tags because the actual HTML
tags are <strong>&lt; title&gt; ... </title></strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-1.png"" /></p>
<p>To find the title tags in the HTML, search <strong>Ctrl + F "" <title>""</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

<h3>Meta Description</h3>
<p>The meta description is the short little blurb under the page title on SERPs.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11-2.png"" /></p>
<p>It is like the summarizing subheading of an article under the headline.</p>

University</a>.</div><!-- /wp:serpco/serpco-blockquote-01-editable -->",https://devinschumacher.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=15330&action=edit,,,,,"## What Is Image Alt-Text?

Image alt-text is an HTML tag that describes an image to search engines.

It's kind of like a long-tail keyword for images.

But why? What's the point?

Alt text has 2 primary purposes.

  1. Search engines cannot (yet) see an image and _understand_ what it is. One reason is because they can't ""see"" anything. But another reason is that search engines create meaning primarily by reading words. That's why keywords are so important. Big advances in image recognition is happening everyday, so this wont be true forever, but for now - it's how the game works.
  2. Screen readers. A screen reader is a software program that helps blind (or visually impaired) users to read the text displayed on a computer screen. The technology uses a speech synthesizer, or braille display. Since images aren't text - there is nothing to read. But an image is worth a thousand words - and they really help create the full picture of the content (pun intended). So, without ""alt text"" there would be nothing for a screen reader to read.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-39-2.png)

It can also be referred to as the alt attribute, alt description or alt tag.

Here's a visual example to help you understand.

The image.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-44-2.png)

The alt-text.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-43-2.png)

You can look at the alt-text for any image on the internet — here's how to do
so.

Right click on an image and select **""Inspect.""**

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-42-1.png)

An interface will appear — the HTML of the image will be highlighted — the alt
tag ( **alt="" ... ""** ) should be there.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-41-2.png)

## Why Is The Image Alt-Text Important For SEO?

The alt-text is important because search engines cannot see images — they only
see the back-end HTML.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-46-1024x554-1.png)

The image alt-text (along with other image tags) communicates to search
engines what an image is about.

This is important because it can help provide search engines more context to
what your webpage is about. This will improve your SEO efforts.

It also helps you rank highly for image searches — these are alternative
pathways to your webpage/website.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-47-1024x498-1.png)

Some websites rely largely on image searches for website traffic.

Getty Images is a good example.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-1-1024x505-1.png)

In fact, [they sued Google](https://time.com/4307769/google-getty-images/)
when they changed its image search interface to encourage piracy of stock
images.

## Best Practice

  * Make It Descriptive And Specific 
  * Keep It Short
  * Feature A Keyword
  * Avoid Keyword Stuffing
  * Avoid Using ""Image Of/Picture Of""
  * Use The longdesc Tag When Appropriate

### Make It Descriptive And Specific

The most important thing is to make sure the image alt-text accurately
describes the image.

You need to ensure that it is descriptive, and specific.

Here's an example — an image of a cat.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-52-2.png)

The alt-text for this image should be ""A black cat eating food.""

If you don't trust my example, then how about Google?

In its [image best practice
guide](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/114016?hl=en), there are
good and bad examples.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-51-2.png)

A simple, one sentence explanation of what the image is about.

In some instances you can provide much more context to an image — look at this
alt-text for a bag of Doritos:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-56-1.png)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-55-1.png)

 **""Doritos Nacho Cheese Flavored Tortilla Chips, 1.75 Ounce (Pack of 64)""**

Some images (such as consumer products) will need extended alt text
descriptions — things like brand names and product descriptions.

Remember the keys — specific and descriptive — this is the most primary best
practice to follow.

 **Takeaway:** Make sure your image alt-text is descriptive and specific.

### Keep It Short

You want to make sure that your image alt-texts are relatively short — less
than 125 characters.

Why?

Because image alt-texts are also used to help visually impaired people
understand images.

The tool that does this is called a screen reader.

A screen reader is a computer program that converts images and text into a
format visually impaired people can understand.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-53-1.png)

Screen readers only read up to 125 characters — this is why you need to keep
your image alt-text short.

The average word is between 4.5 and 6 characters — according to [this
calculator](http://www.unitconversion.org/data-storage/characters-to-words-
conversion.html) 125 characters is 62.5 words.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-54-1.png)

That's really quite a lot of words.

In most cases you won't come close to using 62.5 words.

For instances where you must exceed 125 characters, consider the longdesc tag
(more on this later.)

 **Takeaway:** Keep your image alt-text under 125 characters.

### Feature A Keyword

Just like most of the other important HTML tags, you'll want to put a keyword
in your image alt-texts.

Search engines — such as Google — use image alt-texts to better understand
images and subsequently entire webpages.

Keywords give them extremely specific context to what your images and webpage
is about.

[Google even
recommends](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/114016?hl=en) that
you use keywords in your image alt-text.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-2.png)

Popular WordPress SEO plugin Yoast recommends at least one image with a
keyword (keyphrase) featuring alt-text.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-2-1.png)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-3.png)

Try not to overuse keywords — as the Google image best practice guide says —
use appropriately and in context.

 **Takeaway:** Use a keyword in your image alt-text when it makes sense.

### Avoid Keyword Stuffing

You'll want to avoid putting too many keywords in your image alt-texts.

This practice of overusing keywords is called ""keyword stuffing.""

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-49-1.png)

Keyword stuffing relates to just about every aspect of on-page SEO — too many
keywords will negatively affect your search ranking efforts.

[Google's best practice for images
guide](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/114016?hl=en) explicitly
states to avoid keyword stuffing.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-48-2.png)

There's really no reason to include more than one keyword, and one that is
actually relevant to descibe the image.

 **Takeaway:** Don't overuse keywords in your image alt-texts.

### Avoid Using ""Image Of/Picture Of""

It's common for people to start off their alt-text with the phrases ""image of""
and ""picture of.""

You shouldn't do this.

Google (and other search engines) already knows that it is an image — that's
what HTML tags do.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-5.png)

Using the phrases ""picture of"" and ""image of"" is a waste of your image alt-
text.

Now, you won't hurt your SEO efforts if you do this — it's just not necessary.

If I were to write the alt text for this image below, the alt-text would be
""Dog catching a frisbee at the park.""

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png)

Not "" **Image of** a dog catching a frisbee at the park.""

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-7.png)

 **Takeaway:** Avoid using the phrases ""image of"" and ""picture of"" to start
off your image alt-texts.

### Use The longdesc Tag When Appropriate

Extremely complex images may require an extended description — more than 125
characters.

In these instances where you must exceed 125 characters, you should use the
longdesc tag.

The longdesc tag is a HTML attribute designed for extremely lengthy
descriptions of images.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-50-1.png)

It works by providing a URL to a separate webpage uniquely created to describe
the image extensively.

It looks like this in the HTML.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8.png)

The longdesc tag can be added to support an alt-text, or just by itself (like
the above image.)

It's best to have an alt-text though, because search engines don't crawl
longdesc tags (doesn't influence SEO.)

The main benefit of the longdesc tag is increased user experience
(accessibility) for the visually impaired.

The longdesc tag is used for images that are highly complex, like graphs.

This is an example — imagine how detailed your description would need to be.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-9-1024x621-1.png)A very complex image.

You might be wondering what the point of the longdesc tag is, if it doesn't
affect SEO?

Improving user experience for the visually impaired ([who are 2-3% of the
adult population](https://nfb.org/blindness-statistics)) can indirectly
influence SEO.

More importantly however, is that using longdesc tags can prepare you for the
future of search engines.

Search engines — such as Google — over time have become more and more
semantic, contextual.

The longdesc tag is the ultimate semantic tool for your images.

**Takeaway:** Use the longdesc tag to support the alt-text for overly complex
images.

## Final Thoughts

The image alt-text is the most important HTML tag for images — it's kind of
like long-tail keyword for them.

The right image alt-texts can bolster your overall webpage SEO and get you
ranking on image searches.

<p>Image alt-text is an HTML tag that describes an image to search engines.</p>
<p>It's kind of like a long-tail keyword for images.</p>
<p>But why? What's the point?</p>
<p>Alt text has 2 primary purposes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Search engines cannot (yet) see an image and <em>understand</em> what it is. One reason is because they can't ""see"" anything. But another reason is that search engines create meaning primarily by reading words. That's why keywords are so important. Big advances in image recognition is happening everyday, so this wont be true forever, but for now - it's how the game works.</li>
<li>Screen readers. A screen reader is a software program that helps blind (or visually impaired) users to read the text displayed on a computer screen. The technology uses a speech synthesizer, or braille display. Since images aren't text - there is nothing to read. But an image is worth a thousand words - and they really help create the full picture of the content (pun intended). So, without ""alt text"" there would be nothing for a screen reader to read.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-39-2.png"" /></p>
<p>It can also be referred to as the alt attribute, alt description or alt tag.</p>
<p>Here's a visual example to help you understand.</p>
<p>The image.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-44-2.png"" /></p>
<p>The alt-text.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-43-2.png"" /></p>
<p>You can look at the alt-text for any image on the internet — here's how to do
so.</p>
<p>Right click on an image and select <strong>""Inspect.""</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-42-1.png"" /></p>
<p>An interface will appear — the HTML of the image will be highlighted — the alt
tag ( <strong>alt="" ... ""</strong> ) should be there.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-41-2.png"" /></p>
<h2>Why Is The Image Alt-Text Important For SEO?</h2>
<p>The alt-text is important because search engines cannot see images — they only
see the back-end HTML.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-46-1024x554-1.png"" /></p>
<p>The image alt-text (along with other image tags) communicates to search
engines what an image is about.</p>
<p>This is important because it can help provide search engines more context to
what your webpage is about. This will improve your SEO efforts.</p>
<p>It also helps you rank highly for image searches — these are alternative
pathways to your webpage/website.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-47-1024x498-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Some websites rely largely on image searches for website traffic.</p>
<p>Getty Images is a good example.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-1-1024x505-1.png"" /></p>
<p>In fact, <a href=""https://time.com/4307769/google-getty-images/"">they sued Google</a>
when they changed its image search interface to encourage piracy of stock
images.</p>
<h2>Best Practice</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make It Descriptive And Specific </li>
<li>Keep It Short</li>
<li>Feature A Keyword</li>
<li>Avoid Keyword Stuffing</li>
<li>Avoid Using ""Image Of/Picture Of""</li>
<li>Use The longdesc Tag When Appropriate</li>
</ul>
<h3>Make It Descriptive And Specific</h3>
<p>The most important thing is to make sure the image alt-text accurately
describes the image.</p>
<p>You need to ensure that it is descriptive, and specific.</p>
<p>Here's an example — an image of a cat.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-52-2.png"" /></p>
<p>The alt-text for this image should be ""A black cat eating food.""</p>
<p>If you don't trust my example, then how about Google?</p>
<p>In its <a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/114016?hl=en"">image best practice
guide</a>, there are
good and bad examples.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-51-2.png"" /></p>
<p>A simple, one sentence explanation of what the image is about.</p>
<p>In some instances you can provide much more context to an image — look at this
alt-text for a bag of Doritos:</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-56-1.png"" /></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-55-1.png"" /></p>
<p><strong>""Doritos Nacho Cheese Flavored Tortilla Chips, 1.75 Ounce (Pack of 64)""</strong></p>
<p>Some images (such as consumer products) will need extended alt text
descriptions — things like brand names and product descriptions.</p>
<p>Remember the keys — specific and descriptive — this is the most primary best
practice to follow.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Make sure your image alt-text is descriptive and specific.</p>
<h3>Keep It Short</h3>
<p>You want to make sure that your image alt-texts are relatively short — less
than 125 characters.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because image alt-texts are also used to help visually impaired people
understand images.</p>
<p>The tool that does this is called a screen reader.</p>
<p>A screen reader is a computer program that converts images and text into a
format visually impaired people can understand.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-53-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Screen readers only read up to 125 characters — this is why you need to keep
your image alt-text short.</p>
<p>The average word is between 4.5 and 6 characters — according to <a href=""http://www.unitconversion.org/data-storage/characters-to-words-
conversion.html"">this
calculator</a> 125 characters is 62.5 words.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-54-1.png"" /></p>
<p>That's really quite a lot of words.</p>
<p>In most cases you won't come close to using 62.5 words.</p>
<p>For instances where you must exceed 125 characters, consider the longdesc tag
(more on this later.)</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Keep your image alt-text under 125 characters.</p>
<h3>Feature A Keyword</h3>
<p>Just like most of the other important HTML tags, you'll want to put a keyword
in your image alt-texts.</p>
<p>Search engines — such as Google — use image alt-texts to better understand
images and subsequently entire webpages.</p>
<p>Keywords give them extremely specific context to what your images and webpage
is about.</p>
<p><a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/114016?hl=en"">Google even
recommends</a> that
you use keywords in your image alt-text.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-2.png"" /></p>
<p>Popular WordPress SEO plugin Yoast recommends at least one image with a
keyword (keyphrase) featuring alt-text.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-2-1.png"" /></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-3.png"" /></p>
<p>Try not to overuse keywords — as the Google image best practice guide says —
use appropriately and in context.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Use a keyword in your image alt-text when it makes sense.</p>
<h3>Avoid Keyword Stuffing</h3>
<p>You'll want to avoid putting too many keywords in your image alt-texts.</p>
<p>This practice of overusing keywords is called ""keyword stuffing.""</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-49-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Keyword stuffing relates to just about every aspect of on-page SEO — too many
keywords will negatively affect your search ranking efforts.</p>
<p><a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/114016?hl=en"">Google's best practice for images
guide</a> explicitly
states to avoid keyword stuffing.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-48-2.png"" /></p>
<p>There's really no reason to include more than one keyword, and one that is
actually relevant to descibe the image.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Don't overuse keywords in your image alt-texts.</p>
<h3>Avoid Using ""Image Of/Picture Of""</h3>
<p>It's common for people to start off their alt-text with the phrases ""image of""
and ""picture of.""</p>
<p>You shouldn't do this.</p>
<p>Google (and other search engines) already knows that it is an image — that's
what HTML tags do.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-5.png"" /></p>
<p>Using the phrases ""picture of"" and ""image of"" is a waste of your image alt-
text.</p>
<p>Now, you won't hurt your SEO efforts if you do this — it's just not necessary.</p>
<p>If I were to write the alt text for this image below, the alt-text would be
""Dog catching a frisbee at the park.""</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-6.png"" /></p>
<p>Not "" <strong>Image of</strong> a dog catching a frisbee at the park.""</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-7.png"" /></p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Avoid using the phrases ""image of"" and ""picture of"" to start
off your image alt-texts.</p>
<h3>Use The longdesc Tag When Appropriate</h3>
<p>Extremely complex images may require an extended description — more than 125
characters.</p>
<p>In these instances where you must exceed 125 characters, you should use the
longdesc tag.</p>
<p>The longdesc tag is a HTML attribute designed for extremely lengthy
descriptions of images.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-50-1.png"" /></p>
<p>It works by providing a URL to a separate webpage uniquely created to describe
the image extensively.</p>
<p>It looks like this in the HTML.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-8.png"" /></p>
<p>The longdesc tag can be added to support an alt-text, or just by itself (like
the above image.)</p>
<p>It's best to have an alt-text though, because search engines don't crawl
longdesc tags (doesn't influence SEO.)</p>
<p>The main benefit of the longdesc tag is increased user experience
(accessibility) for the visually impaired.</p>
<p>The longdesc tag is used for images that are highly complex, like graphs.</p>
<p>This is an example — imagine how detailed your description would need to be.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-9-1024x621-1.png"" />A very complex image.</p>
<p>You might be wondering what the point of the longdesc tag is, if it doesn't
affect SEO?</p>
<p>Improving user experience for the visually impaired (<a href=""https://nfb.org/blindness-statistics"">who are 2-3% of the
adult population</a>) can indirectly
influence SEO.</p>
<p>More importantly however, is that using longdesc tags can prepare you for the
future of search engines.</p>
<p>Search engines — such as Google — over time have become more and more
semantic, contextual.</p>
<p>The longdesc tag is the ultimate semantic tool for your images.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Use the longdesc tag to support the alt-text for overly complex
images.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The image alt-text is the most important HTML tag for images — it's kind of
like long-tail keyword for them.</p>
<p>The right image alt-texts can bolster your overall webpage SEO and get you
ranking on image searches.</p>

Every image on the internet has a unique name given to it — this is called the
image filename.

Here is what it looks like as HTML.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-16.png)

You can also see the filename of an image when saved offline, on your
computer.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-17-1.png)![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-18.png)

When you create, edit or save an image, you give it a filename.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-14-1.png)

Images come in various different file formats (such as PNG above.) This has no
bearing on the name.

You can give an image just about any filename, although there are some
exceptions.

The maximum length is 256 characters.

You can't use any of these types of characters:

`**#  < > [ ] | : { } /** **~**`

You can view the filename of any image on the internet — here's how.

 **Right click on the image and select ""Inspect.""**

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11-1.png)

The image HTML should come up — look for the src tag — focus on the unique end
slug (highlighted below.)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-13-1.png)

 **""online-advertising""**

That's the image filename.

## Why Is The Image Filename Important For SEO?

Because Google (and other [search engines](https://devinschumacher.com/search-
engines/)) can't see images like we do.

We see the image.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-29-1.png)

They see the image HTML — search engines see only the web source code in the
back-end.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-28-1.png)

So when it comes to SEO for images, the HTML is all you've got to communicate
to Google.

The image filename (along with the [image alt-
text](https://devinschumacher.com/alt-text/)) tells search engines exactly
what an image is about.

I like to think of the filename as a short-tail keyword for images.

You're also probably wondering why images are even important for SEO in the
first place.

 **I'll give you 2 main reasons why.**

  * Images can help give search engines a better idea to what your overall webpage is about.
  * Optimizing images for SEO can help you rank for image searches.

The image filename and alt-text can help add to other HTML elements (like the
page title.) This gives search engines a better idea on what a particular
webpage is about.

Here's a good example — an article about how to shave your dog.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-23-1024x505-1.png)

Look at this image.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-24-1024x505-1.png)

Look at the image filename and alt-text.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-25.png)

The more information you can give search engines — like Google — the better
your SEO efforts will be.

Ranking for image searches is also important because they provide more
pathways for traffic to reach your website/webpages.

Look what happens when I image search ""How to shave your dog.""

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-26-1024x505-1.png)

5 of the first 10 images are from that article — these are all pathways to
your webpage/website.

Some websites generate majority of their traffic (and revenue/sales) from
image searches.

Stock image websites — such as Shutterstock — is a good example of this.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-20-1024x505-1.png)![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-19-1024x489-1.png)

## Best Practice

  * Avoid Generic Filenames
  * Describe The Image Accurately
  * Use A Keyword
  * Avoid Keyword Stuffing
  * Keep It As Short As Possible
  * Use Hyphens (Not Underscores)

## Avoid Generic Filenames

The first thing you'll want to do is to avoid giving your image a generic
filename.

What is considered generic?

Here are some examples of generic filenames.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-30-1.png)

  *  **Image01.png**
  *  **Joe.jpg**
  *  **DSC00001.JPG**
  *  **309969513162641.jpg**

When you fail to give your image a filename, you'll be given a generic
default, similar to the above examples.

The problem with these generic image filenames is that they tell Google (and
other search engines) nothing.

Your image's filename (along with the alt-text) is supposed to give
information on what the image is about.

A filename that tells nothing about the context of an image provides no SEO
value.

## Describe The Image Accurately

You'll want to describe your image with as much clarity and specificity as
possible.

Your image filename needs to tell search engines exactly what the image is
about.

Here are some good examples.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-31-1.png)

  *  **City of London skyline from London City Hall - Oct 2008.jpg**
  *  **KDE Kicker config screenshot.png**
  *  **1863 Meeting of Settlers and Maoris at Hawke's Bay, New Zealand.jpg**
  *  **Polyhedron with no vertex visible from center.png**

Google even highlights the importance of a ""descriptive"" image filename in its
[best practice
guide](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/114016?hl=en).

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-33.png)

> The filename can give Google clues about the subject matter of the image.
> For example, **my-new-black-kitten.jpg** is better than **IMG00023.JPG**

This doesn't really need to get complicated — simply describe your image in a
succinct, precise manner.

Some images however, will need a bit more context to be accurately described.

Here's an example.

An image of the London skyline.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-34.png)

The image filename is **City of London skyline from London City Hall - Oct
2008.jpg**

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-35.png)

This provides some additional information:

  * The date the image was taken
  * The position from which the image was taken

Don't forget to consider the use of hyphens to separate words, and to keep it
short (these are covered further down.)

 **Takeaway:** Describe your image accurately, succinctly and specifically.

## Use A Keyword

Like most other HTML tags, the image filename is a good place to put a
keyword.

When Googlebot comes to crawl your webpage, it's going to be looking at your
images. It's only good things SEO-wise if it finds a keyword there.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-36.png)

This largely relates to the ""accurately describing your image"" point listed
earlier.

The images you use should have high relevance to the topic of your webpage,
and thus your keyword/s.

Look at this example — How to Wash a Dog.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-37-1024x505-1.png)

Look at the filename for the first image.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-39-1.png)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-38-1024x505-1.png)

A keyword has been featured — you can bet this will help Google better crawl,
rank and index this webpage.

Remember, it needs to be actually relevant to the image. It needs to actually
describe the image.

## Avoid Keyword Stuffing

So, you'll want to use a keyword in your filename — if it fits — but you need
to avoid overdoing it.

When you overuse keywords, it's called ""keyword stuffing.""

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-40.png)

When search engines (like Google) notice you have used a keyword too
frequently, they will penalize you.

You can even get de-indexed (completely removed.)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-41-1.png)

Search engines (like Google) over time have become more and more ""semantic.""

This means that they've become more ... smartererer. They can tell when you're
trying to game the system — like keyword stuffing.

The fix is simple — only use keywords when it actually describes the image.

## Keep It As Short As Possible

As was stated at the beginning of this post, the maximum length of an image
filename is 256 characters.

But exactly what is the optimal length?

The truth is, there isn't one.

Some image filenames are only 1 word.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-44-1.png)![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-45.png)

While some can be over 50+ characters.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-43-1.png)![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-42.png)

Naturally, some images (like the 1863 one above) require more words to be
accurately described.

So it wouldn't really make sense for there to be an exact number.

This is different to something like say, the page title. It's firmly placed in
back-end web source code.

User experience really isn't a factor here.

I still recommend keeping it short — as short as it can possibly be — given
you accurately describe it.

There is no need to put in filler or fluff. God forbid don't keyword stuff.
Detail all the important things to describe the image as accurately as
possible.

However long that is.

No more, no less.

 **Takeaway:** Describe your image accurately, in the shortest, most precise
manner.

## Use Hyphens (Not Underscores)

Regarding your image filenames, It's important to remember use hyphens to
separate words, not underscores.

You want it to look like this.

Not this.

Or this.

When it comes to HTML, hyphens (-) signal a break in words to search engines.
They are considered a ""word separator.""

[Google's own filename and file types
guide](https://developers.google.com/style/filenames) recommends using
hyphens, not underscores.

They even outline some examples similar to the ones I gave you earlier.

Using underscores won't ruin your image filename, but it's best to just use
hyphens.

## Final Thoughts

The filename is like the short-tail keyword of the image — it tells search
engines (like Google) just exactly what it's looking at.

A high quality image filename can help your webpage rank better, and your
images too (for image searches.)

Knowing how to best optimize the image filename is important. In this post we
covered everything you need to know.","<h2>What Is An Image Filename?</h2>
<p>Every image on the internet has a unique name given to it — this is called the
image filename.</p>
<p>Here is what it looks like as HTML.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-16.png"" /></p>
<p>You can also see the filename of an image when saved offline, on your
computer.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-17-1.png"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-18.png"" /></p>
<p>When you create, edit or save an image, you give it a filename.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-14-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Images come in various different file formats (such as PNG above.) This has no
bearing on the name.</p>
<p>You can give an image just about any filename, although there are some
exceptions.</p>
<p>The maximum length is 256 characters.</p>
<p>You can't use any of these types of characters:</p>
<p><code>**#  &lt; &gt; [ ] | : { } /** **~**</code></p>
<p>You can view the filename of any image on the internet — here's how.</p>
<p><strong>Right click on the image and select ""Inspect.""</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11-1.png"" /></p>
<p>The image HTML should come up — look for the src tag — focus on the unique end
slug (highlighted below.)</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-13-1.png"" /></p>
<p><strong>""online-advertising""</strong></p>
<p>That's the image filename.</p>
<h2>Why Is The Image Filename Important For SEO?</h2>
<p>Because Google (and other <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/search-
engines/"">search engines</a>) can't see images like we do.</p>
<p>We see the image.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-29-1.png"" /></p>
<p>They see the image HTML — search engines see only the web source code in the
back-end.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-28-1.png"" /></p>
<p>So when it comes to SEO for images, the HTML is all you've got to communicate
to Google.</p>
<p>The image filename (along with the <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/alt-text/"">image alt-
text</a>) tells search engines exactly
what an image is about.</p>
<p>I like to think of the filename as a short-tail keyword for images.</p>
<p>You're also probably wondering why images are even important for SEO in the
first place.</p>
<p><strong>I'll give you 2 main reasons why.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Images can help give search engines a better idea to what your overall webpage is about.</li>
<li>Optimizing images for SEO can help you rank for image searches.</li>
</ul>
<p>The image filename and alt-text can help add to other HTML elements (like the
page title.) This gives search engines a better idea on what a particular
webpage is about.</p>
<p>Here's a good example — an article about how to shave your dog.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-23-1024x505-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Look at this image.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-24-1024x505-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Look at the image filename and alt-text.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-25.png"" /></p>
<p>The more information you can give search engines — like Google — the better
your SEO efforts will be.</p>
<p>Ranking for image searches is also important because they provide more
pathways for traffic to reach your website/webpages.</p>
<p>Look what happens when I image search ""How to shave your dog.""</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-26-1024x505-1.png"" /></p>
<p>5 of the first 10 images are from that article — these are all pathways to
your webpage/website.</p>
<p>Some websites generate majority of their traffic (and revenue/sales) from
image searches.</p>
<p>Stock image websites — such as Shutterstock — is a good example of this.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-20-1024x505-1.png"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-19-1024x489-1.png"" /></p>
<h2>Best Practice</h2>
<ul>
<li>Avoid Generic Filenames</li>
<li>Describe The Image Accurately</li>
<li>Use A Keyword</li>
<li>Avoid Keyword Stuffing</li>
<li>Keep It As Short As Possible</li>
<li>Use Hyphens (Not Underscores)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Avoid Generic Filenames</h2>
<p>The first thing you'll want to do is to avoid giving your image a generic
filename.</p>
<p>What is considered generic?</p>
<p>Here are some examples of generic filenames.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-30-1.png"" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Image01.png</strong></li>
<li><strong>Joe.jpg</strong></li>
<li><strong>DSC00001.JPG</strong></li>
<li><strong>309969513162641.jpg</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you fail to give your image a filename, you'll be given a generic
default, similar to the above examples.</p>
<p>The problem with these generic image filenames is that they tell Google (and
other search engines) nothing.</p>
<p>Your image's filename (along with the alt-text) is supposed to give
information on what the image is about.</p>
<p>A filename that tells nothing about the context of an image provides no SEO
value.</p>
<h2>Describe The Image Accurately</h2>
<p>You'll want to describe your image with as much clarity and specificity as
possible.</p>
<p>Your image filename needs to tell search engines exactly what the image is
about.</p>
<p>Here are some good examples.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-31-1.png"" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>City of London skyline from London City Hall - Oct 2008.jpg</strong></li>
<li><strong>KDE Kicker config screenshot.png</strong></li>
<li><strong>1863 Meeting of Settlers and Maoris at Hawke's Bay, New Zealand.jpg</strong></li>
<li><strong>Polyhedron with no vertex visible from center.png</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Google even highlights the importance of a ""descriptive"" image filename in its
<a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/114016?hl=en"">best practice
guide</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-33.png"" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The filename can give Google clues about the subject matter of the image.
For example, <strong>my-new-black-kitten.jpg</strong> is better than <strong>IMG00023.JPG</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't really need to get complicated — simply describe your image in a
succinct, precise manner.</p>
<p>Some images however, will need a bit more context to be accurately described.</p>
<p>Here's an example.</p>
<p>An image of the London skyline.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-34.png"" /></p>
<p>The image filename is <strong>City of London skyline from London City Hall - Oct
2008.jpg</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-35.png"" /></p>
<p>This provides some additional information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The date the image was taken</li>
<li>The position from which the image was taken</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't forget to consider the use of hyphens to separate words, and to keep it
short (these are covered further down.)</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Describe your image accurately, succinctly and specifically.</p>
<h2>Use A Keyword</h2>
<p>Like most other HTML tags, the image filename is a good place to put a
keyword.</p>
<p>When Googlebot comes to crawl your webpage, it's going to be looking at your
images. It's only good things SEO-wise if it finds a keyword there.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-36.png"" /></p>
<p>This largely relates to the ""accurately describing your image"" point listed
earlier.</p>
<p>The images you use should have high relevance to the topic of your webpage,
and thus your keyword/s.</p>
<p>Look at this example — How to Wash a Dog.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-37-1024x505-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Look at the filename for the first image.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-39-1.png"" /></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-38-1024x505-1.png"" /></p>
<p>A keyword has been featured — you can bet this will help Google better crawl,
rank and index this webpage.</p>
<p>Remember, it needs to be actually relevant to the image. It needs to actually
describe the image.</p>
<h2>Avoid Keyword Stuffing</h2>
<p>So, you'll want to use a keyword in your filename — if it fits — but you need
to avoid overdoing it.</p>
<p>When you overuse keywords, it's called ""keyword stuffing.""</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-40.png"" /></p>
<p>When search engines (like Google) notice you have used a keyword too
frequently, they will penalize you.</p>
<p>You can even get de-indexed (completely removed.)</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-41-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Search engines (like Google) over time have become more and more ""semantic.""</p>
<p>This means that they've become more ... smartererer. They can tell when you're
trying to game the system — like keyword stuffing.</p>
<p>The fix is simple — only use keywords when it actually describes the image.</p>
<h2>Keep It As Short As Possible</h2>
<p>As was stated at the beginning of this post, the maximum length of an image
filename is 256 characters.</p>
<p>But exactly what is the optimal length?</p>
<p>The truth is, there isn't one.</p>
<p>Some image filenames are only 1 word.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-44-1.png"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-45.png"" /></p>
<p>While some can be over 50+ characters.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-43-1.png"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-42.png"" /></p>
<p>Naturally, some images (like the 1863 one above) require more words to be
accurately described.</p>
<p>So it wouldn't really make sense for there to be an exact number.</p>
<p>This is different to something like say, the page title. It's firmly placed in
back-end web source code.</p>
<p>User experience really isn't a factor here.</p>
<p>I still recommend keeping it short — as short as it can possibly be — given
you accurately describe it.</p>
<p>There is no need to put in filler or fluff. God forbid don't keyword stuff.
Detail all the important things to describe the image as accurately as
possible.</p>
<p>However long that is.</p>
<p>No more, no less.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Describe your image accurately, in the shortest, most precise
manner.</p>
<h2>Use Hyphens (Not Underscores)</h2>
<p>Regarding your image filenames, It's important to remember use hyphens to
separate words, not underscores.</p>
<p>You want it to look like this.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-46.png"" /></p>
<p>Not this.</p>

<p>Or this.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-48-1.png"" /></p>
<p>When it comes to HTML, hyphens (-) signal a break in words to search engines.
They are considered a ""word separator.""</p>

Duplicate content is when two pieces of content are exactly the same, or
similar. This can be content on the same website, or two separate websites.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-51-1.png)

For good measure, here's Google's definition of ""duplicate content.""

> Duplicate content generally refers to substantive blocks of content within
> or across domains that either completely match other content or are
> appreciably similar.

Obviously instances of duplicate content will involve stealing from others,
but lots of the time it happens in ""non-sinister"" contexts.

Here are some good examples.

  *  **Printer-only version of a webpage (also known as printer-friendly)**

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-56.png)

  *  **Discussion forums with a mobile optimized version**

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-57.png)

  *  **Commercial items with various different URL links (social, affiliate, etc)**

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-58.png)

## How Does Duplicate Content Affect SEO?

Google does not want to index content that is not original — they want
original, unique and informative content.

This is what Google (and other search engines) wants appearing on SERPs, not
cut and paste content-spun dupes.

They even state this in their [duplicate content
guidelines](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66359?hl=en).

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-55.png)

A copied webpage is not a page with ""distinct information.""

Further down they emphasize the potential negative SEO consequences of
duplicate content.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-54.png)

> As a result, the ranking of the site may suffer, or the site might be
> removed entirely from the Google index, in which case it will no longer
> appear in search results.

Duplicate content can drop you in the search rankings, or get you de-indexed
all together.

This is why it's important regarding SEO, and why we need to address it.

## Best Practice

  * Check Out What Pages Of Your Website Are Indexed
  * Search The Internet For Duplicate Content Of Yours
  * Check Your Website For Proper Redirection 
  * Use The Canonical Tag (When It Makes Sense)
  * Use The 301 Redirect
  * Utilize A Top-Level Domain For Country-Specific Content
  * Use The Noindex Tag On Category And Tag Pages (WordPress)

### Check Out What Pages Of Your Website Are Indexed

You need to find out what pages of your website are being indexed. This is the
first step you should take.

It’s always good practice to check what pages of your website are showing up
on Google.

You can check for indexed pages through [Google Search
Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about).

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-60.png)

The easiest way however, is to check through Google search.

To do this, search for “ **site:yourwebsite.com”**

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-61-1.png)

It should come up with all your ranking, indexed pages.

Check the number of results against the number of pages you have.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-62.png)

You should be able to find any ""domestic"" instances of duplicate content.

Alternatively you can use a tool specifically designed to find internal
duplicate content — such as [Siteliner](http://www.siteliner.com/).

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-65-1024x499-1.png)

It will give you an overview of your website, with a duplicate content
analysis.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-66-1.png)

There is a premium version, but you should be covered with the free version.

 **Takeaway:** Use Google Search Console, ""site:yourwebsite.com"" or Siteliner
to find out what pages your website are being indexed.

### Search The Internet For Duplicate Content Of Yours

You've done an internal duplicate content check, now it's time for an external
one.

People will often rip-off your content and post it as their own. Unfortunately
sometimes search engines give the original the boot as opposed to the
copy/duplicate.

So let's track down these fakes — we'll do it with the help of
[Copyscape](https://www.copyscape.com/).

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-67-1024x504-1.png)

Copyscape is a plagiarism tool that can help you find out who's stealing your
content.

Simply type your website address into the Copyscape search bar and 10 pages
copying your content will appear.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-69.png)

You can click on each result, and it will show the exact words copied
(highlighted in pink) and a percentage.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-71.png)

Anything less than 40% is really nothing to worry about.

 **Takeaway:** Use Copyscape to find people copying your content.

### Check Your Website For Proper Redirection

People are often surprised to find out that they have multiple versions of the
same website.

When you have multiple versions of your website, search engines — like Google
— will treat it as a duplicate content situation.

It is rare, but it does happen.

 **There are 2 common scenarios where this might happen**.

  1. Switching from HTTP to HTTPS.
  2. WWW site separate from non-WWW (www.google.com vs google.com) 

You must make sure whatever variations of your site exist, go to the same one.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-59-1.png)

In the past you could address this issue with Google Search Console, but this
no longer true.

[On June 18 of 2019 Google removed the ""preferred domain""
setting](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/06/bye-bye-preferred-domain-
setting.html).

As an alternative, they outlined 4 strategies you could use.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-73.png)

  * The canonical tag (HTML pages)
  * The canonical tag (HTTP header)
  * Sitemap
  * 301 redirect attribute

The canonical tag and 301 redirect attribute will be covered later on in this
post.

 **Takeaway:** Redirect all versions of your website (http/https/www) to a
single one.

### Use The Canonical Tag (When It Makes Sense)

The canonical tag ( **rel=canonical** ) is a HTML element that lets Google
know what page is the original.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-74.png)

It basically says ""this is the original piece of content, not the other ones.""

When you communicate this to Google you are telling them to crawl, index and
rank this webpage/content. You are telling Google to ignore the others.

This is one of the easiest and most effective ways to address duplicate
content.

 **There are 2 ways you can use the canonical tag.**

  1. Added to the HTML source code
  2. Added to the HTTP header

Adding it to the HTTP header is a little more technical — I'll just cover the
HTML.

You can manually insert the tag straight into the HTML.

Here is an example from CNN.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-63-1.png)

 **< link rel""canonical"" href=""insert link"">**

Simply copy the example and plug in the desired link.

An easier way however, is to just do it with a CMS platform plugin.

WordPress SEO Plugin Yoast has a canonical tag form for pages/posts.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-64-1.png)

 **Takeaway:** Use the canonical tag (rel=canonical) to tell search engines a
page is original.

### Use The 301 Redirect

A 301 redirect is a HTML code that permanently changes the direction of a
link.

This is for both users and search engines.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-75.png)

Using a 301 redirect will transfer the ""link juice"" (link equity) to the new
link.

It says to search engines ""hey, everything you've crawled, indexed and ranked
about this page? Please send it to this other page.""

A 301 redirect is used when you want to update an existing page by creating a
new page. It combines the two pages in a SEO sense.

The new page will be given all the SEO value from the old one, thanks to the
301 redirect.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-52-1.png)

To use a 301 redirect you need to access your website's htaccess file — this
can get technical.

Once again, the simpler option is to use a CMS plugin.

WordPress has plenty to choose from.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-76.png)

 **Takeaway:** Use the 301 Redirect to re-route users and search engines to a
new updated page.

### Utilize A Top-Level Domain For Country-Specific Content

A top-level domain is the end part of a website address (domain) — the "".com""
section.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-77.png)

 **There are 2 types of top-level domains.**

  1. Generic top-level domains (gTLD)
  2. Country-code top-level domains (ccTLD)

Generic top-level domains are more common/universal, such as com, org and net.

Country-code top-level domains vary depending on the specific region.

For instance, South Africa uses za.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-78.png)

Australia uses au.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-79.png)

It's important that if you have duplicate content for different countries and
languages, you might be penalized.

This is where the right ccTLD comes in handy.

A ccTLD helps to communicate to Google that you have multiple versions of your
website and content for a reason.

Google even recommends it in their [duplicate content
guide](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66359?hl=en).

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-80.png)

> To help us serve the most appropriate version of a document, use top-level
> domains whenever possible to handle country-specific content. We're more
> likely to know that `http://www.example.de` contains Germany-focused
> content, for instance, than `http://www.example.com/de` or
> `http://de.example.com`.

A ccTLD is only appropriate if your website operates in multiple countries.

 **There are also some downsides to using a ccTLD.**

They can be quite expensive to maintain.

Each separate ccTLD website needs to build up its own domain authority — this
can take time.

If ccTLDs are not a good choice for your needs, subdomains and subdirectories
are your next best bet.

 **Takeaway:** Use a country-code top-level domain to combat regional
duplicate content issues.

### Use The Noindex Tag On Category And Tag Pages (WordPress)

If you're using WordPress, you'll notice category and tag pages are
automatically created.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-81-1024x415-1.png)

Category and tag pages are used to help website visitors and search engines
navigate your content.

The problem with these pages is that they often cause duplicate content
issues.

To combat this, you'll want to hit these pages with the **noindex tag**.

The noindex tag is a HTML tag that tells Google (and other search engines) not
to index this page

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-82.png)

You are basically telling them ""don't put this webpage on your search engine,
I don't want it there.""

It's also important to notice the difference between **noindex, follow** and
**noindex, nofollow**.

The index tag is actually bundled with the follow tag ⁠— this all happens in
the robots meta tag. Every page has got a robots meta tag, it's found in the
head of your HTML.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-83.png)

Many other tags exist in the robots meta tag, not just the index and follow
ones.

The difference between noindex, follow and noindex, nofollow is simple.

 **Noindex, follow** = Not indexed by search engines, but SEO value still
passed through links on page.

 **Noindex, nofollow** = Not indexed by search engines, no SEO value passed
through links on page.

So with regards to WordPress category and tag pages creating duplicate
content, we'll use noindex, follow.

Add **< meta name=""robots"" content=""noindex, follow"">** to your page head
HTML.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-84.png)

If that's too complicated for you, just do it with a SEO plugin such as Yoast.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-85.png)

 **Takeaway:** Use the noindex tag on category and tag pages (WordPress) to
combat duplicate content issues.

## Final Thoughts

Duplicate content is an issue that can significantly affect your SEO efforts.

Knowing how to combat it is vitally important.

Follow these best practice guidelines to avoid duplicate content altogether.

University](http://serpuniversity.com/).","<h2>What Is Duplicate Content?</h2>
<p>Duplicate content is when two pieces of content are exactly the same, or
similar. This can be content on the same website, or two separate websites.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-51-1.png"" /></p>
<p>For good measure, here's Google's definition of ""duplicate content.""</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Duplicate content generally refers to substantive blocks of content within
or across domains that either completely match other content or are
appreciably similar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously instances of duplicate content will involve stealing from others,
but lots of the time it happens in ""non-sinister"" contexts.</p>
<p>Here are some good examples.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Printer-only version of a webpage (also known as printer-friendly)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-56.png"" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discussion forums with a mobile optimized version</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-57.png"" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commercial items with various different URL links (social, affiliate, etc)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-58.png"" /></p>
<h2>How Does Duplicate Content Affect SEO?</h2>
<p>Google does not want to index content that is not original — they want
original, unique and informative content.</p>
<p>This is what Google (and other search engines) wants appearing on SERPs, not
cut and paste content-spun dupes.</p>
<p>They even state this in their <a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66359?hl=en"">duplicate content
guidelines</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-55.png"" /></p>
<p>A copied webpage is not a page with ""distinct information.""</p>
<p>Further down they emphasize the potential negative SEO consequences of
duplicate content.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-54.png"" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a result, the ranking of the site may suffer, or the site might be
removed entirely from the Google index, in which case it will no longer
appear in search results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Duplicate content can drop you in the search rankings, or get you de-indexed
all together.</p>
<p>This is why it's important regarding SEO, and why we need to address it.</p>
<h2>Best Practice</h2>
<ul>
<li>Check Out What Pages Of Your Website Are Indexed</li>
<li>Search The Internet For Duplicate Content Of Yours</li>
<li>Check Your Website For Proper Redirection </li>
<li>Use The Canonical Tag (When It Makes Sense)</li>
<li>Use The 301 Redirect</li>
<li>Utilize A Top-Level Domain For Country-Specific Content</li>
<li>Use The Noindex Tag On Category And Tag Pages (WordPress)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Check Out What Pages Of Your Website Are Indexed</h3>
<p>You need to find out what pages of your website are being indexed. This is the
first step you should take.</p>
<p>It’s always good practice to check what pages of your website are showing up
on Google.</p>
<p>You can check for indexed pages through <a href=""https://search.google.com/search-console/about"">Google Search
Console</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-60.png"" /></p>
<p>The easiest way however, is to check through Google search.</p>
<p>To do this, search for “ <strong>site:yourwebsite.com”</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-61-1.png"" /></p>
<p>It should come up with all your ranking, indexed pages.</p>
<p>Check the number of results against the number of pages you have.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-62.png"" /></p>
<p>You should be able to find any ""domestic"" instances of duplicate content.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can use a tool specifically designed to find internal
duplicate content — such as <a href=""http://www.siteliner.com/"">Siteliner</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-65-1024x499-1.png"" /></p>
<p>It will give you an overview of your website, with a duplicate content
analysis.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-66-1.png"" /></p>
<p>There is a premium version, but you should be covered with the free version.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Use Google Search Console, ""site:yourwebsite.com"" or Siteliner
to find out what pages your website are being indexed.</p>
<h3>Search The Internet For Duplicate Content Of Yours</h3>
<p>You've done an internal duplicate content check, now it's time for an external
one.</p>
<p>People will often rip-off your content and post it as their own. Unfortunately
sometimes search engines give the original the boot as opposed to the
copy/duplicate.</p>
<p>So let's track down these fakes — we'll do it with the help of
<a href=""https://www.copyscape.com/"">Copyscape</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-67-1024x504-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Copyscape is a plagiarism tool that can help you find out who's stealing your
content.</p>
<p>Simply type your website address into the Copyscape search bar and 10 pages
copying your content will appear.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-69.png"" /></p>
<p>You can click on each result, and it will show the exact words copied
(highlighted in pink) and a percentage.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-71.png"" /></p>
<p>Anything less than 40% is really nothing to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Use Copyscape to find people copying your content.</p>
<h3>Check Your Website For Proper Redirection</h3>
<p>People are often surprised to find out that they have multiple versions of the
same website.</p>
<p>When you have multiple versions of your website, search engines — like Google
— will treat it as a duplicate content situation.</p>
<p>It is rare, but it does happen.</p>
<p><strong>There are 2 common scenarios where this might happen</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Switching from HTTP to HTTPS.</li>
<li>WWW site separate from non-WWW (www.google.com vs google.com) </li>
</ol>
<p>You must make sure whatever variations of your site exist, go to the same one.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-59-1.png"" /></p>
<p>In the past you could address this issue with Google Search Console, but this
no longer true.</p>
<p><a href=""https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/06/bye-bye-preferred-domain-
setting.html"">On June 18 of 2019 Google removed the ""preferred domain""
setting</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-72.png"" /></p>

Local SEO refers to the specific set of SEO tasks that aim to help increase
your local web presence and drive more traffic into your storefront (or from
your city and the neighboring cities).

Local SEO helps bring more customers to you by improving your visibility in
search results that are designed to satisfy local search queries (like
""dentist near me"" or ""dentist in los angeles, ca"" and in the map listings.

Local SEO is all about improving search engine visibility for businesses that
serve their customers in person, or within a certain distance from their
business location. This includes businesses with physical locations (like a
dentist or chiropractor) or service-area businesses that operate in a
geographic area (like a plumber, electrician, or carpet cleaner).

There are different ""rules"" and different search results for ""local search
queries"", so knowing how to optimize for Local SEO should be a huge part of a
local type business's SEO strategy.

## Why is Local SEO Important?

According to a study by Forbes, 95% of smartphone users have used their phone
to perform local searches. 61% of those people ended up calling the business
and 59% actually visited it.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/01/local-seo-4.jpg)

And here are some jaw-dropping stats from @ThinkWithGoogle:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

## What is a Local Search?

A ""local search"" or ""local search query"" is a search query that produces a
search engine results page ([SERP](http://staging-
devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud)) that caters to a locality, or geographic area.

A local search can either be a search query with a ""local modifier"" on it, for
example, adding a city name, or zip code, or ""near me"" to the end of your
search query.

 **Examples of local modifiers:**

  * dentist office **near me**
  * plumber **los angeles, ca**
  * chiropractor **91107**

I have put the **local modifiers** above in bold so you can see them more
easily.

A local search will produce a Local SERP.

## What is a Local SERP?

For example, if I search ""plastic surgeon pasadena, ca"" I, the searcher, am
clearly looking for a local business to provide me with some kind of product
or service. Google knows this and wants to satisfy my search intent, so they
produce a SERP that has local results on it.

Like so:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/01/local-serp-for-plastic-surgeon-pasadena-ca.png)

In this SERP we see maps (business listings in the location being searched).

We also see Yelp (a directory that gives users lists of businesses near them).

We also see an actual local business on the organic results -
pasadenacosmeticsurgery.com.

### Non local SERP

Just for the sake of distinction, so you can really see the difference, let's
quickly look at a non-local SERP.

To do this we will need to do a ""non-local search query"" - something that is
not location dependent.

How about ""how to learn to snowboard""

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/01/non-local-serp-1.png)

Above is a screenshot of the first part of the SERP. We see informational
content (not local-based content) about learning how to snowboard - because
this is something Google has determined people are not looking for a local
business to help them with.

We see Videos. Why? Because Google knows that the best way to learn how to
snowboard (other than going to the mountain) is through video. It would be
much harder to learn from a book.

If we scroll down, we will see Organic Results:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/01/2non-local-serp-2.png)

Lots of great information & websites all about helping the searcher learn how
to snowboard.

Maybe if I had performed this search in a ski town (like Mammoth, or Vail,
etc.) I would actually have a _mixed SERP_ \- where we see local & non-local
information.

Moving on.

## What is a ""Snack Pack"" (Map Pack)?

The Google Map Pack (aka ""Snack Pack"" or “Local Pack”) is the area of the SERP
that displays 3 local business results when you enter a local search query.
The Map Pack includes easy-to-access information about the business such as:
Name, Address, Phone Number, Reviews, etc.

The Map Pack is a huge driver of traffic, leads & sales for local businesses
who can get their listing up there in the top 3.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/)src: backlinko

For example, if you search for an seo company in Whittier, California, you
will see a map pack show up with our listing at the top. And yes, it has
brought us clients :)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/)

## What Are The Main Local SEO Ranking Factors?

  * Google Business Profile
  * Searcher's location
  * Relevance of the search query
  * Business Prominence
  * Authority of the page
  * Authority of the Domain

Most of the factors that will contribute to your Local SEO success fall into
one of 3 buckets:

  *  **Proximity:**  How close the searcher is to the business.
  *  **Relevance:**  How relevant the search query is to the business looking to show up.
  *  **Prominence:**  How prominent is your brand in consumers' eyes.

### Google My Business Profile

Your Google My Business (GMB) profile has a big effect on your local SEO
ranking. We cover this more in an article dedicated to Google My Business
optimization, and also with an entire course dedicated to it in [SERP
University](http://serpuniversity.com).

However, the fundamental thing to know here is that you want to give your GMB
as much love as possible.

Fill out all the fields with good descriptions of your business, and work in
SERVICE + LOCATION based keywords when possible.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/)

You also want to make sure you get as much rich media (photos, videos, etc.)
uploaded to your profile as possible.

The easiest way to think about this is to fill in as much information as you
can.

Google always wants more information on you, so give it to them. They will
even prompt you like this:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/)

Finally, you will want to keep all your business information consistent across
your website, GMB and other business directories.

 **Pro tip** : Your business information can get jumbled over time. Check your
business information across your directories once every 6 months. You can do
this quickly & easily [here with our local seo
tool.](https://www.optimizelocation.com/partner/serpco/diagnostic.html)

### Searcher's location

The location of the searcher has a huge impact on the local results that show
up.

Google knows that we humans like our convenience and all things being equal we
would prefer to travel less distance to get to a service provider - so they
take that into account.

Using a handy little tool called LocalFalcon we can see where one of our
dental clients is ranking in the maps from different areas around their
location.

The spots on the map show the position in the Local Map Pack where they are
ranking when searched from that exact spot. Notice how the further away you
get from the business location, their rankings go down? That's normal.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/)

### Relevance of the search query

Another huge part of Google delivering you (the searcher) a relevant result
that will keep you happy and continuing to use them instead of Yahoo, is
making sure that the results they provide you are relevant to what you are
searching.

Just like we (searchers) want local results in close proximity to where we
are, we also want results that are highly relevant.

For example, if I need an attorney to help me with a car accident I want to
make sure that when I search I get a list of attorneys who specialize in car
accidents and not an attorney who specializes in family law.

So, when I search for ""motorcycle accident lawyer new york"" I see results that
Google has deemed to be hyper-relevant for that. Not just Personal Injury
lawyers (which is the ""category"" of law that deals with this sort of thing)
but Personal Injury lawyers who specifically specialize in this sub-category,
motorcycle injuries.

We see it in the maps and in the Organic listings below the maps.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/01/Screen_Shot_2020-01-12_at_1_18_12_PM.png)

### Business Prominence

This is a tough one, but it makes a lot of sense.

Google wants to show (aka recommend) business to consumers that do good work.
If a business screws over a customer, who found the business on the top of the
first page using Google Search, that consumer might begin to not trust Google
so much.

So, Google feels more comfortable putting a business at the top of their list
if they can rest easy knowing that business does good work. How does it know
this? Well, there are a lot of factors.

The main things you can do to help your business prominence is trying to
improve things like:

  * Quantity of reviews
  * Quality of reviews
  * Mentions of your business on other relevant websites
  * Links to your business from other relevant websites
  * Brand name searches (do people type your brand name into Google?)
  * etc.

### Authority of the page

The authority of the actual local lander you are trying to rank plays a huge
part in if you will show up.

This means that if you are trying to rank your homepage for a keyword then you
want links to your homepage.

But, if you are trying to rank an inner page then you will want to build the
authority of that page using
[backlinks](https://devinschumacher.com/backlinks/).

For example, if you have multiple locations (or services) you will want to
create dedicated inner pages called ""local landers"" for them and [build
links](https://devinschumacher.com/link-building/) to those URLs.

Here is an example where we did that to rank for ""seo company whittier ca""

![](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/)

### Authority of the Domain

In addition to Page Level authority, your chances of ranking for local terms
(or any terms for that matter) increase as the entire authority of your domain
increases.

Why do you think Yelp ranks for pretty much every local term? Because their
entire website is about local businesses and they have a huge level of domain
authority.

As you can see here from this screenshot of Ahrefs, they have a Domain Rating
(DR) of 94:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/)

## What Are Directories & Citations?

Business directories are independent websites on the internet that catalog &
organize business contact information.

Some of these websites you may recognize include: Yelp, Yellowpages, Dexknows,
Manta, Foursquare, etc.

Getting your business listed on these trusted business directories helps
establish your brand prominence, will create
[backlinks](https://devinschumacher.com/backlinks/) to your website, and will
give your business a brand mention accompanied by your contact information,
called a NAP (Name, Address & Phone Number).

Any mention of your business NAP is called a
[citation](https://devinschumacher.com/citations/).

Citations help Google understand that your business is a legitimate business
that has taken the time to get listed on relevant, trusted directories.

### Google My Business

Google My Business is a free business profile that helps you reach & engage
with potential customers across Google Search and Maps.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/)

We have entire articles & even mini-courses dedicated to Google My Business in
[SERP University](http://serpuniversity.com), because done right it can be the
primary driver of new leads, sales & revenue for a local business.

#### Google My Business Optimization

Let's briefly discuss the things you will want to optimize to improve the
presence of your GMB.

  *  **NAP** \- Name, Address, Phone Number. This is your business name with its contact information. The key to this is keeping it up to date and consistent across all mentions/citations around the internet.
  *  **URL** \- The URL that leads people to your website. The key to this is making your URL point to the local lander that is dedicated to ranking for the specific local search term you are targeting.
  *  **Description** \- Your business description tells consumers about your business. The key here is to include service & location related keywords within the description to improve your relevance.
  *  **Services** \- A list of the services your business provides. The key here is to fill it out completely, and use synonyms when possible. 
  * **Rich Media** \- Rich media is images, videos, etc. Google loves it and so do customers. It builds trust & helps you stand out from your competitors. It also is great for SEO. The key here is to create & publish as much rich media as possible!
  *  **Reviews** \- Reviews are a huge trust factor, both to potential customers and to Google. The key here is to get as many reviews as you can. Ideally, they will be good reviews (so make sure you take care of your customers!) Also, you want to get service & location keywords inside the reviews. And finally, you want to respond to all reviews!

#### Google My Business Optimization for Ranking in Maps

After you have optimized your Google My Business using the strategies detailed
above, you will want to start on the other [ranking
factors](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/) that will help
improve your visibility.

### Directories

As mentioned earlier, business directories allow you to promote the contact
information of your company.

Create a list of these categories of business directories, and then get
listed:

  1.  **General Directories** \- Start with the primary trusted directories. These would include places like Yelp, Yellowpages, Dexknows, Manta, Foursquare, etc.
  2.  **Industry Directories** \- After you secure a listed on the main directories, look for industry-specific directories to get listed on. These could be things like: 1800dentist.com, HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack, Zillow, Realtor.com, Avvo, etc. 
  3. Location Directories - After you secure listings on your industry-specific directories, look for ones that are specific to your city or geography.

#### Citation Audit

A citation audit is a process you can use to help improve your local rankings.

It should include:

  * Cleaning up citations
  * Improving existing citations
  * Identifying new citation opportunities

If you need some help building your own citation audit process, let us know in
[SERP University](http://serpuniversity.com/).

### Website Improvements - Local Lander Optimization

By this point, you should have a well-optimized GMB, and a solid presence on
business directories around the web - you're off to a great start!

![](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/)

This next part is what separates the winners from the losers, and it's website
optimization.

#### What is a ""Local Lander""?

A local lander is a page on your website dedicated to a specific
geographically modified search term.

That's a mouthful, but basically it is a way that we can create a hyper-
relevant page around a specific search term that we know would be valuable for
your business to rank for.

Say for example you want to rank for ""seo company whittier ca"", (yes we're
gonna beat this example to death)

If someone is searching a term that specific you can bet your bananas they are
about ready to spend some money.

A marketing agency in Los Angeles would probably love that lead - but without
a page optimized for, and dedicated to, the search term they will never show
up for that.

Why? Because Google is always trying to give the searcher the **most relevant
result.**

So, the solution is to create a local lander! Like we did.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/)

To create a local lander optimized for a term, you will want to include the
following elements:

  * Optimized URL, Title Tags, Headers, Meta Description, and Content
  * Google Map Embed
  * Driving Directions
  * Internal links

#### Local Schema

Schema, also called ""structured data"", is a way to further define what your
business is, who it serves & what you provide to search engines in a way that
is standardized and easy for them to understand.

Implement [local business schema](https://schema.org/LocalBusiness) on your
homepage to improve its relevance.

On your local lander, we recommend using service or location schema.

### Local Blog

Create a blog on your website & write about things that are happening locally.
Reach out to other websites talking about these events and people talking
about them on social media to plug your article. Always try to be getting
links.

 **Some ideas for local blog content:**

  * Content about a local charity or cause that your business supports.
  * Local news, activities or events.
  * Sponsor local meetups.

### Off-Page SEO Link Building

The last part of your Local SEO strategy should be link building.

This is arguably the most powerful part, so why save it for last?

Well, because it's also the most expensive part - and very often if you get
everything else right first, you won't even need to do this part.

So, think of link building for local SEO as your trump card that you keep in
your hand until totally necessary.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/)

#### Association Links

You already have a good foundation of links from the Citations you have built.
So now, the next obvious step is to start acquiring links from industry-
relevant associations.

Join & participate in local associations - especially ones that you can get a
backlink from.

**Some examples of local associations:**

  * Chamber of Commerce
  * BNI
  * Better Business Bureau
  * Your alma mater
  * A local study club
  * etc.

#### Competitor Links

Competitor link building is a process where you make a list of the people
ranking on Page 1 for the terms you want to be ranking for, analyze their
backlinks, and then try to go get them yourself.

For this example, we will use a Dentist in Sacramento.

 **Step 1 -** Start by Googling your search term:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/)

 **Step 2 -** Create a spreadsheet with a list of everyone who is ranking on
Page 1 & 2:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/)

 **Step 3** \- Use ahrefs to find who is linking to each website, and make a
list of those URLs (these are your ""potential linkers"")

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-12-at-2.53.18-PM.png)

Repeat for each website on your Competitor Spreadsheet

 **Step 4** \- Look at the links your competitors have, and try to acquire
them yourself by reaching out to the websites

#### Local Forums

Local forums are a great place to get some brand exposure for your business in
front of consumers who are interested in the products & services you provide -
and also an opportunity to potentially acquire a NAP listing and/or backlink.

Use Google to search for forums in your industry or geography.

Here are some helpful ""search operators"" you can use to do this easily:

  * [INDUSRTY] forum
  * [INDUSRTY] forums
  * [CITY] forum
  * [CITY] forums

#### News Portals

New outlets are great for brand awareness and potential links. Make a list of
the news websites in your area and contact them for a feature.

#### Local Blogs

Local blogs are another great place to get some exposure. The people who run
these are always looking for interesting people, places & things in their
community to write about - so make their job easier and contact them first!

## How To Track Your Map Rankings?

Now that you have put in all this work to improve your local seo presence, you
will want to measure & track your visibility, rankings, traffic, leads, new
customers & sales value from all your effort.

We recommend implementing a variety of tracking to accomplish this.

First, you will want to track your map rankings, for this we recommend using a
rank tracker, like [SERP App](http://serp.app).

Next, make sure you have properly set up your Google Analytics to be able to
understand where visitors are coming from, and which ones are completing goals
on your website (for example: filling out a contact form or calling the phone
number in your menu bar).

  * To track phone calls, use a call tracking tool like CallRail.

## Final Thoughts

Local SEO is the way you get your business ranked in Local SERPs, Maps &
Organic SERPs. This is the primary driver of new business for many
local/service-based companies and can drive an insane amount of new business
to you if done right.

If you implement the tools & strategies discussed in this article you will be
in a fantastic position for scooping up a ton of super relevant traffic that
is very ready to make a purchase.

<p>According to a study by Forbes, 95% of smartphone users have used their phone
to perform local searches. 61% of those people ended up calling the business
and 59% actually visited it.</p>

<p>And here are some jaw-dropping stats from @ThinkWithGoogle:</p>

<p>Tweet that. So you never forget it:</p>
<blockquote>

<h2>What is a Local Search?</h2>
<p>A ""local search"" or ""local search query"" is a search query that produces a
search engine results page (<a href=""http://staging-
devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud"">SERP</a>) that caters to a locality, or geographic area.</p>
<p>A local search can either be a search query with a ""local modifier"" on it, for
example, adding a city name, or zip code, or ""near me"" to the end of your
search query.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of local modifiers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>dentist office <strong>near me</strong></li>
<li>plumber <strong>los angeles, ca</strong></li>
<li>chiropractor <strong>91107</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I have put the <strong>local modifiers</strong> above in bold so you can see them more
easily.</p>
<p>A local search will produce a Local SERP.</p>
<h2>What is a Local SERP?</h2>
<p>For example, if I search ""plastic surgeon pasadena, ca"" I, the searcher, am
clearly looking for a local business to provide me with some kind of product
or service. Google knows this and wants to satisfy my search intent, so they
produce a SERP that has local results on it.</p>
<p>Like so:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/01/local-serp-for-plastic-surgeon-pasadena-ca.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/"" /></a></p>
<p>In this SERP we see maps (business listings in the location being searched).</p>
<p>We also see Yelp (a directory that gives users lists of businesses near them).</p>
<p>We also see an actual local business on the organic results -
pasadenacosmeticsurgery.com.</p>
<h3>Non local SERP</h3>
<p>Just for the sake of distinction, so you can really see the difference, let's
quickly look at a non-local SERP.</p>
<p>To do this we will need to do a ""non-local search query"" - something that is
not location dependent.</p>
<p>How about ""how to learn to snowboard""</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/01/non-local-serp-1.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/"" /></a></p>
<p>Above is a screenshot of the first part of the SERP. We see informational
content (not local-based content) about learning how to snowboard - because
this is something Google has determined people are not looking for a local
business to help them with.</p>
<p>We see Videos. Why? Because Google knows that the best way to learn how to
snowboard (other than going to the mountain) is through video. It would be
much harder to learn from a book.</p>
<p>If we scroll down, we will see Organic Results:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/01/2non-local-serp-2.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/"" /></a></p>
<p>Lots of great information &amp; websites all about helping the searcher learn how
to snowboard.</p>
<p>Maybe if I had performed this search in a ski town (like Mammoth, or Vail,
etc.) I would actually have a <em>mixed SERP</em> - where we see local &amp; non-local
information.</p>
<p>Moving on.</p>
<h2>What is a ""Snack Pack"" (Map Pack)?</h2>
<p>The Google Map Pack (aka ""Snack Pack"" or “Local Pack”) is the area of the SERP
that displays 3 local business results when you enter a local search query.
The Map Pack includes easy-to-access information about the business such as:
Name, Address, Phone Number, Reviews, etc.</p>
<p>The Map Pack is a huge driver of traffic, leads &amp; sales for local businesses
who can get their listing up there in the top 3.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/"" />src: backlinko</p>
<p>For example, if you search for an seo company in Whittier, California, you
will see a map pack show up with our listing at the top. And yes, it has
brought us clients :)</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/"" /></p>
<h2>What Are The Main Local SEO Ranking Factors?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Google Business Profile</li>
<li>Searcher's location</li>
<li>Relevance of the search query</li>
<li>Business Prominence</li>
<li>Authority of the page</li>
<li>Authority of the Domain</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the factors that will contribute to your Local SEO success fall into
one of 3 buckets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proximity:</strong>  How close the searcher is to the business.</li>
<li><strong>Relevance:</strong>  How relevant the search query is to the business looking to show up.</li>
<li><strong>Prominence:</strong>  How prominent is your brand in consumers' eyes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Google My Business Profile</h3>
<p>Your Google My Business (GMB) profile has a big effect on your local SEO
ranking. We cover this more in an article dedicated to Google My Business
optimization, and also with an entire course dedicated to it in <a href=""http://serpuniversity.com"">SERP
University</a>.</p>
<p>However, the fundamental thing to know here is that you want to give your GMB
as much love as possible.</p>
<p>Fill out all the fields with good descriptions of your business, and work in
SERVICE + LOCATION based keywords when possible.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/"" /></p>
<p>You also want to make sure you get as much rich media (photos, videos, etc.)
uploaded to your profile as possible.</p>
<p>The easiest way to think about this is to fill in as much information as you
can.</p>
<p>Google always wants more information on you, so give it to them. They will
even prompt you like this:</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/"" /></p>
<p>Finally, you will want to keep all your business information consistent across
your website, GMB and other business directories.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong> : Your business information can get jumbled over time. Check your
business information across your directories once every 6 months. You can do
this quickly &amp; easily <a href=""https://www.optimizelocation.com/partner/serpco/diagnostic.html"">here with our local seo
tool.</a></p>
<h3>Searcher's location</h3>
<p>The location of the searcher has a huge impact on the local results that show
up.</p>
<p>Google knows that we humans like our convenience and all things being equal we
would prefer to travel less distance to get to a service provider - so they
take that into account.</p>
<p>Using a handy little tool called LocalFalcon we can see where one of our
dental clients is ranking in the maps from different areas around their
location.</p>
<p>The spots on the map show the position in the Local Map Pack where they are
ranking when searched from that exact spot. Notice how the further away you
get from the business location, their rankings go down? That's normal.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/"" /></p>
<h3>Relevance of the search query</h3>
<p>Another huge part of Google delivering you (the searcher) a relevant result
that will keep you happy and continuing to use them instead of Yahoo, is
making sure that the results they provide you are relevant to what you are
searching.</p>
<p>Just like we (searchers) want local results in close proximity to where we
are, we also want results that are highly relevant.</p>
<p>For example, if I need an attorney to help me with a car accident I want to
make sure that when I search I get a list of attorneys who specialize in car
accidents and not an attorney who specializes in family law.</p>
<p>So, when I search for ""motorcycle accident lawyer new york"" I see results that
Google has deemed to be hyper-relevant for that. Not just Personal Injury
lawyers (which is the ""category"" of law that deals with this sort of thing)
but Personal Injury lawyers who specifically specialize in this sub-category,
motorcycle injuries.</p>
<p>We see it in the maps and in the Organic listings below the maps.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/01/Screen_Shot_2020-01-12_at_1_18_12_PM.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/"" /></a></p>
<h3>Business Prominence</h3>
<p>This is a tough one, but it makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>Google wants to show (aka recommend) business to consumers that do good work.
If a business screws over a customer, who found the business on the top of the
first page using Google Search, that consumer might begin to not trust Google
so much.</p>
<p>So, Google feels more comfortable putting a business at the top of their list
if they can rest easy knowing that business does good work. How does it know
this? Well, there are a lot of factors.</p>
<p>The main things you can do to help your business prominence is trying to
improve things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quantity of reviews</li>
<li>Quality of reviews</li>
<li>Mentions of your business on other relevant websites</li>
<li>Links to your business from other relevant websites</li>
<li>Brand name searches (do people type your brand name into Google?)</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Authority of the page</h3>
<p>The authority of the actual local lander you are trying to rank plays a huge
part in if you will show up.</p>
<p>This means that if you are trying to rank your homepage for a keyword then you
want links to your homepage.</p>
<p>But, if you are trying to rank an inner page then you will want to build the
authority of that page using
<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/backlinks/"">backlinks</a>.</p>
<p>For example, if you have multiple locations (or services) you will want to
create dedicated inner pages called ""local landers"" for them and <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/link-building/"">build
links</a> to those URLs.</p>
<p>Here is an example where we did that to rank for ""seo company whittier ca""</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/"" /></p>
<h3>Authority of the Domain</h3>
<p>In addition to Page Level authority, your chances of ranking for local terms
(or any terms for that matter) increase as the entire authority of your domain
increases.</p>
<p>Why do you think Yelp ranks for pretty much every local term? Because their
entire website is about local businesses and they have a huge level of domain
authority.</p>
<p>As you can see here from this screenshot of Ahrefs, they have a Domain Rating
(DR) of 94:</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/"" /></p>
<h2>What Are Directories &amp; Citations?</h2>
<p>Business directories are independent websites on the internet that catalog &amp;
organize business contact information.</p>
<p>Some of these websites you may recognize include: Yelp, Yellowpages, Dexknows,
Manta, Foursquare, etc.</p>
<p>Getting your business listed on these trusted business directories helps
establish your brand prominence, will create
<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/backlinks/"">backlinks</a> to your website, and will
give your business a brand mention accompanied by your contact information,
called a NAP (Name, Address &amp; Phone Number).</p>
<p>Any mention of your business NAP is called a
<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/citations/"">citation</a>.</p>
<p>Citations help Google understand that your business is a legitimate business
that has taken the time to get listed on relevant, trusted directories.</p>

<h3>Google My Business</h3>
<p>Google My Business is a free business profile that helps you reach &amp; engage
with potential customers across Google Search and Maps.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/"" /></p>
<p>We have entire articles &amp; even mini-courses dedicated to Google My Business in
<a href=""http://serpuniversity.com"">SERP University</a>, because done right it can be the
primary driver of new leads, sales &amp; revenue for a local business.</p>
<h4>Google My Business Optimization</h4>
<p>Let's briefly discuss the things you will want to optimize to improve the
presence of your GMB.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NAP</strong> - Name, Address, Phone Number. This is your business name with its contact information. The key to this is keeping it up to date and consistent across all mentions/citations around the internet.</li>
<li><strong>URL</strong> - The URL that leads people to your website. The key to this is making your URL point to the local lander that is dedicated to ranking for the specific local search term you are targeting.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong> - Your business description tells consumers about your business. The key here is to include service &amp; location related keywords within the description to improve your relevance.</li>
<li><strong>Services</strong> - A list of the services your business provides. The key here is to fill it out completely, and use synonyms when possible. </li>
<li><strong>Rich Media</strong> - Rich media is images, videos, etc. Google loves it and so do customers. It builds trust &amp; helps you stand out from your competitors. It also is great for SEO. The key here is to create &amp; publish as much rich media as possible!</li>
<li><strong>Reviews</strong> - Reviews are a huge trust factor, both to potential customers and to Google. The key here is to get as many reviews as you can. Ideally, they will be good reviews (so make sure you take care of your customers!) Also, you want to get service &amp; location keywords inside the reviews. And finally, you want to respond to all reviews!</li>
</ul>
<h4>Google My Business Optimization for Ranking in Maps</h4>
<p>After you have optimized your Google My Business using the strategies detailed
above, you will want to start on the other <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/"">ranking
factors</a> that will help
improve your visibility.</p>
<h3>Directories</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, business directories allow you to promote the contact
information of your company.</p>
<p>Create a list of these categories of business directories, and then get
listed:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>General Directories</strong> - Start with the primary trusted directories. These would include places like Yelp, Yellowpages, Dexknows, Manta, Foursquare, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Industry Directories</strong> - After you secure a listed on the main directories, look for industry-specific directories to get listed on. These could be things like: 1800dentist.com, HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack, Zillow, Realtor.com, Avvo, etc. </li>
<li>Location Directories - After you secure listings on your industry-specific directories, look for ones that are specific to your city or geography.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Citation Audit</h4>
<p>A citation audit is a process you can use to help improve your local rankings.</p>
<p>It should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning up citations</li>
<li>Improving existing citations</li>
<li>Identifying new citation opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need some help building your own citation audit process, let us know in
<a href=""http://serpuniversity.com/"">SERP University</a>.</p>
<h3>Website Improvements - Local Lander Optimization</h3>
<p>By this point, you should have a well-optimized GMB, and a solid presence on
business directories around the web - you're off to a great start!</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/"" /></p>
<p>This next part is what separates the winners from the losers, and it's website
optimization.</p>
<h4>What is a ""Local Lander""?</h4>
<p>A local lander is a page on your website dedicated to a specific
geographically modified search term.</p>
<p>That's a mouthful, but basically it is a way that we can create a hyper-
relevant page around a specific search term that we know would be valuable for
your business to rank for.</p>
<p>Say for example you want to rank for ""seo company whittier ca"", (yes we're
gonna beat this example to death)</p>
<p>If someone is searching a term that specific you can bet your bananas they are
about ready to spend some money.</p>
<p>A marketing agency in Los Angeles would probably love that lead - but without
a page optimized for, and dedicated to, the search term they will never show
up for that.</p>
<p>Why? Because Google is always trying to give the searcher the <strong>most relevant
result.</strong></p>
<p>So, the solution is to create a local lander! Like we did.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/"" /></p>
<p>To create a local lander optimized for a term, you will want to include the
following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimized URL, Title Tags, Headers, Meta Description, and Content</li>
<li>Google Map Embed</li>
<li>Driving Directions</li>
<li>Internal links</li>
</ul>
<h4>Local Schema</h4>
<p>Schema, also called ""structured data"", is a way to further define what your
business is, who it serves &amp; what you provide to search engines in a way that
is standardized and easy for them to understand.</p>
<p>Implement <a href=""https://schema.org/LocalBusiness"">local business schema</a> on your
homepage to improve its relevance.</p>
<p>On your local lander, we recommend using service or location schema.</p>
<h3>Local Blog</h3>
<p>Create a blog on your website &amp; write about things that are happening locally.
Reach out to other websites talking about these events and people talking
about them on social media to plug your article. Always try to be getting
links.</p>
<p><strong>Some ideas for local blog content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Content about a local charity or cause that your business supports.</li>
<li>Local news, activities or events.</li>
<li>Sponsor local meetups.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Off-Page SEO Link Building</h3>
<p>The last part of your Local SEO strategy should be link building.</p>
<p>This is arguably the most powerful part, so why save it for last?</p>
<p>Well, because it's also the most expensive part - and very often if you get
everything else right first, you won't even need to do this part.</p>
<p>So, think of link building for local SEO as your trump card that you keep in
your hand until totally necessary.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/"" /></p>
<h4>Association Links</h4>
<p>You already have a good foundation of links from the Citations you have built.
So now, the next obvious step is to start acquiring links from industry-
relevant associations.</p>
<p>Join &amp; participate in local associations - especially ones that you can get a
backlink from.</p>
<p><strong>Some examples of local associations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Chamber of Commerce</li>
<li>BNI</li>
<li>Better Business Bureau</li>
<li>Your alma mater</li>
<li>A local study club</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Competitor Links</h4>
<p>Competitor link building is a process where you make a list of the people
ranking on Page 1 for the terms you want to be ranking for, analyze their
backlinks, and then try to go get them yourself.</p>
<p>For this example, we will use a Dentist in Sacramento.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> Start by Googling your search term:</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/"" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 -</strong> Create a spreadsheet with a list of everyone who is ranking on
Page 1 &amp; 2:</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/"" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Use ahrefs to find who is linking to each website, and make a
list of those URLs (these are your ""potential linkers"")</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-12-at-2.53.18-PM.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/local-seo/"" /></a></p>
<p>Repeat for each website on your Competitor Spreadsheet</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Look at the links your competitors have, and try to acquire
them yourself by reaching out to the websites</p>
<h4>Local Forums</h4>
<p>Local forums are a great place to get some brand exposure for your business in
front of consumers who are interested in the products &amp; services you provide -
and also an opportunity to potentially acquire a NAP listing and/or backlink.</p>
<p>Use Google to search for forums in your industry or geography.</p>
<p>Here are some helpful ""search operators"" you can use to do this easily:</p>
<ul>
<li>[INDUSRTY] forum</li>
<li>[INDUSRTY] forums</li>
<li>[CITY] forum</li>
<li>[CITY] forums</li>
</ul>
<h4>News Portals</h4>
<p>New outlets are great for brand awareness and potential links. Make a list of
the news websites in your area and contact them for a feature.</p>
<h4>Local Blogs</h4>
<p>Local blogs are another great place to get some exposure. The people who run
these are always looking for interesting people, places &amp; things in their
community to write about - so make their job easier and contact them first!</p>
<h2>How To Track Your Map Rankings?</h2>
<p>Now that you have put in all this work to improve your local seo presence, you
will want to measure &amp; track your visibility, rankings, traffic, leads, new
customers &amp; sales value from all your effort.</p>
<p>We recommend implementing a variety of tracking to accomplish this.</p>
<p>First, you will want to track your map rankings, for this we recommend using a
rank tracker, like <a href=""http://serp.app"">SERP App</a>.</p>
<p>Next, make sure you have properly set up your Google Analytics to be able to
understand where visitors are coming from, and which ones are completing goals
on your website (for example: filling out a contact form or calling the phone
number in your menu bar).</p>
<ul>
<li>To track phone calls, use a call tracking tool like CallRail.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Local SEO is the way you get your business ranked in Local SERPs, Maps &amp;
Organic SERPs. This is the primary driver of new business for many
local/service-based companies and can drive an insane amount of new business
to you if done right.</p>
<p>If you implement the tools &amp; strategies discussed in this article you will be
in a fantastic position for scooping up a ton of super relevant traffic that
is very ready to make a purchase.</p>

Keyword density is a term to describe how frequently a keyword is used on a
page, and is hugely important for the success of your SEO campaign.

If you miss your Keyword Density on the low end (under optimizing), you'll
have trouble ranking. If you overshoot Keyword Density on the high end (over
optimizing) - you risk getting your URL/site actively penalized by Google and
disappearing from the SERPs entirely. Don't mess this up.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-87.png)

Look at this equation ⁠— it should help you understand the concept.

 **Keyword density = # of times keyword used ÷ total no. of words on webpage**
**x 100**

If I wrote a 100 word blog post and used a particular keyword twice, the
keyword density would be 2%.

It's also important to note that a keyword can be one word, or many in a
""phrase.""

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-86.png)

A keyword that is 10 words long, used 5 times in a 100 word article, is still
5% keyword density.

## Why Is Keyword Density Important For SEO?

Why is keyword density important for SEO? The simple answer...

Keyword Density is a large factor in helping Google determine what a page is
about. A fundamental aspect of the algorithm - if a page talks about the same
thing over and over on a page it stands to reason that page is probably
centered around that topic.

Keywords are a fundamental aspect of SEO — always have been, always will be.
They are your chance to tell search engines (like Google) exactly what your
webpage is about.

How many times you use your keywords (keyword density) can give Google even
more hints and clues.

Pre 2011, SEOs realized this fact and began to stuff a keyword onto a page as
many times as possible, so when Googlebot would come to your page about ""auto
insurance"" and read that term was on the page 1,000 times it would think
""hmm...this must be SUPER relevant to auto insurance, let's rank them highly"".

This is called "" **keyword stuffing** "".

Google caught on, and introduced ""Panda"" - a huge change to their algorithm
that began to categorize these keyword stuffed / low quality, ""spammy""
websites/webpages that prioritized keywords over content quality.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-88.png)

> ""Hummingbird"" places greater emphasis on natural language queries,
> considering context and meaning over individual keywords.

Over time, search engines have become more and more ""semantic"" or logic-
driven. An unnaturally high keyword density (keyword stuffing) once a viable
SEO strategy, is now blackhat (illegal.)

This is true for all [search engines](https://devinschumacher.com/search-
engines/) (not just Google.)

## Best Practice

  * Aim For 1-3% Keyword Density to start
  * Put Keywords In The Right Places (Keyword Placement)
  * Use Various LSI Keyword Variations
  * Target Multiple Keywords (Keyword Clustering)

### Aim For 1-3% Keyword Density if unsure

Before those big Google updates, it was common to see high-ranking content
with keyword densities as high as 50%.

That's definitely not going to fly today.

 **You want to aim for a keyword density of 1-3%** to start, but like all
things in SEO this can vary from keyword to keywords, and certainly from
industry to industry.

That's a rate of 1-3 keywords per 100 words.

However, if you want to take a more advanced (and frankly better approach) you
will want to analyze the top ranking URLs for any given keyword and see what
their average keyword density is. Then, sculpt yours to fit in somewhere in
the middle. Blend in. Always blend.

[Popular WordPress SEO plugin Yoast](https://en-
au.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) recommends 0.5% to 3%.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-91.png)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-92.png)

[RankMath](https://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-by-rank-math/) (another plugin)
says 1% to 2.5%.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-94.png)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-93.png)

[The Wikipedia article on keyword
density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyword_density) suggests 1-3%.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-95-1024x510-1.png)

The key really, is to not focus on keyword density. You should be prioritizing
writing useful content that helps your readers.

If you do this, naturally your keyword density will fall between 1-3%.

Long-tail keywords are obviously going to be used less than short-tail
keywords.

How often do you think you can use ""how to create a wordpress website""
compared to ""wordpress website.""

 **Again, the key is naturally flowing.**

 **Takeaway:** A 1-3% keyword density is an optimal baseline, but the KEY is
to **blend in**.

### Put Keywords In The Right Places (Keyword Placement)

These days, it's not really how many times you use keywords, but where you put
them.

There are a number of critical places you must have keywords featured.

 **These include:**

  * Page Title (Title Tags)
  * H1 Header (Headline)
  * Subheader (H2, H3)
  * Meta Description (Meta Tags)
  * Image Alt-Text 
  * Image Filename
  * URL Slug

#### Page Title (Title Tags)

The page title — also known as title tags — is the most important place to
have a keyword.

In case you didn't know, the page title is the title of your webpage on SERPs
(search engine results pages.)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-96.png)

It's what tells search engine users exactly what your webpage is about — just
like a headline of an article.

Google (and other search engines) will look at the title tags and see if you
have a keyword here. Make sure you do so, and front-loaded if possible.

#### H1 Header (Headline)

You'll also want to put a keyword within your h1 header — this is your actual
page headline.

content/uploads/2022/08/image-99-1024x480-1.png)

The h1 header is often confused with the [page
title](https://devinschumacher.com/title-tags/) — it's important to know the
difference.

The page title is the headline for your webpage on the SERP.

The h1 header is an HTML element on your webpage designated by an HTML tag
<h1>, that basically tells Google ""hey, this is the primary topic of this
article"".

Remember back to highschool when you were writing an outline to an essay. You
have the Title of your essay (page title), and the main topic I. Main Topic
Here (that's kind of like the h1).

h1 = Heading 1. A primary heading/topic to tell your readers (and search
engines) what the page is talking about.

#### Subheadings (H2, H3)

You should feature keyword variations throughout subheadings — H2, H3, etc.

Why? Well, if these ""headings"" are the _primary topics and subtopics_ of an
article or web page, wouldn't you want to specifically tell Google (using
HTML) that ""hey, this page is really about XYZ"".

Headings & subheadings carry more weight to telling search engines what a page
is about, and is a very influencer [on page
seo](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/) [ranking
factor](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/).

This article is a great example of this.

#### Meta Description (Meta Tags)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-97.png)

A good meta description can increase click-through rates, indirectly impacting
SEO.

The meta description acts as a blurb, or preview of sorts. It lets search
engine users know what your webpage is about.

If you're accurately describing your webpage, you'll most likely use a
keyword.

Although many SEOs will say that the meta description does not directly
influence SEO, if you look closely you will notice that when you search
something on Google, the search engine will **bold** those keywords inside
meta descriptions.... think about that for a second.

#### Image Alt-Text

Google (and other search engines) don't see images visually — only the HTML.

For this reason, you'll want to throw a keyword in at least one image alt-
text.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-103.png)

That being said ... technology is getting much better everyday with image
recognition.

#### Image Filename

You'll want to do the same with your [image
filenames](https://devinschumacher.com/image-filenames/).

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-104.png)

Putting keywords in your [image HTML](https://devinschumacher.com/seo-html-
elements/) is going to help [search
engines](https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/) better understand and
rank your content.

#### URL Slug

Putting a relevant keyword in your URL slug is good practice.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-102.png)

URLs pack a punch when it comes to SEO. In fact, it's one of the top on page
seo factors.

Remember to keep it short.

 **Takeaway:** Put keyword variations in your page title, h1 header, h2/h3
subheader, meta description, image alt-text, image filename and URL slug. Keep
it varied, keep it natural.

### Use Various LSI Keyword Variations

Modern [keyword strategy](https://devinschumacher.com/keyword-research/) is
less about using the same keywords frequently, but using different variations
of your keyword, and supporting topics that make an article comprehensive.

These keyword variations are known as **[LSI
keywords](https://devinschumacher.com/lsi-keywords/)**.

LSI (latent semantic indexing) keywords are words or phrases that are
semantically similar, or highly correlated to your main keywords.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-105.png)

Search engines (such as Google) are intelligent — they look for these related
LSI keywords.

This gives them a better understanding, a better idea of what your webpage is
about.

Google even states so in this [2016 research
paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub45569/).

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-107.png)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-106-1024x618-1.png)

It's also important to note that **LSI keywords are not synonyms**.

**Synonyms** — words that have similar or same meaning.

 **LSI Keywords** — words or phrases that are related to your keyword/keywords
in search engines.

Think of these like topics that you would have to discuss in order to answer
someones question on a particular topic. For example, you can't really have a
beginners guide to camping without discussing things like food, tents, bears &
how to make a fire - even though none of those use the words ""camping"".

Sometimes, synonyms and LSIs are the same. If a synonym is not relevant in
search engines, it is not a LSI keyword.

There are many strategies you can use to find [LSI
keywords](https://devinschumacher.com/lsi-keywords/).

The easiest way is to use the **Google ""autocomplete"" feature**.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-108-1024x504-1.png)

The words suggested — these are [LSI
keywords](https://devinschumacher.com/lsi-keywords/).

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-109.png)

Another strategy you can use is **LSIKeywords.com**.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-110-1024x504-1.png)

Simply type your keywords into the tool — a list of LSI keywords will appear.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-112-1024x343-1.png)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-3-2.gif)

Let's bump the brakes here for a second... why are we talking about LSI
Keywords? Did we just get off topic? No.

The reason is that LSI keywords, keyword variations, synonyms, etc. is what
you _should be using_ to help with your keyword density.

If you have a page you want to rank for ""los angeles orthodontist"" you
shouldn't just plaster that phrase all over the page - you need to dance
around it a bit.

**Takeaway:** Use LSI keyword variations to make your keyword SEO more
semantic, and dilute your keyword density a bit.

## Final Thoughts

In this post we covered keyword density as a concept, its history and its
current state in the SEO world.

Keyword density refers to how many times keywords are using throughout a page,
and is just a ratio to show you how often it appears.

These days it's important to keep keyword density in mind so you don't under-
optimize or over-optimize - but more importantly is strategically placing
keywords throughout your pages for maximum SEO impact, and building semantic
relevance by covering topics succinctly and completely.

To learn more about SEO, continue reading the guides in our learning hub, and
join our mastermind community group here: [SERP
University](http://serpuniversity.com/).","<h2>What Is Keyword Density?</h2>
<p>Keyword density is a term to describe how frequently a keyword is used on a
page, and is hugely important for the success of your SEO campaign.</p>
<p>If you miss your Keyword Density on the low end (under optimizing), you'll
have trouble ranking. If you overshoot Keyword Density on the high end (over
optimizing) - you risk getting your URL/site actively penalized by Google and
disappearing from the SERPs entirely. Don't mess this up.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-87.png"" /></p>
<p>Look at this equation ⁠— it should help you understand the concept.</p>
<p><strong>Keyword density = # of times keyword used ÷ total no. of words on webpage</strong>
<strong>x 100</strong></p>
<p>If I wrote a 100 word blog post and used a particular keyword twice, the
keyword density would be 2%.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that a keyword can be one word, or many in a
""phrase.""</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-86.png"" /></p>
<p>A keyword that is 10 words long, used 5 times in a 100 word article, is still
5% keyword density.</p>
<h2>Why Is Keyword Density Important For SEO?</h2>
<p>Why is keyword density important for SEO? The simple answer...</p>
<p>Keyword Density is a large factor in helping Google determine what a page is
about. A fundamental aspect of the algorithm - if a page talks about the same
thing over and over on a page it stands to reason that page is probably
centered around that topic.</p>
<p>Keywords are a fundamental aspect of SEO — always have been, always will be.
They are your chance to tell search engines (like Google) exactly what your
webpage is about.</p>
<p>How many times you use your keywords (keyword density) can give Google even
more hints and clues.</p>
<p>Pre 2011, SEOs realized this fact and began to stuff a keyword onto a page as
many times as possible, so when Googlebot would come to your page about ""auto
insurance"" and read that term was on the page 1,000 times it would think
""hmm...this must be SUPER relevant to auto insurance, let's rank them highly"".</p>
<p>This is called "" <strong>keyword stuffing</strong> "".</p>
<p>Google caught on, and introduced ""Panda"" - a huge change to their algorithm
that began to categorize these keyword stuffed / low quality, ""spammy""
websites/webpages that prioritized keywords over content quality.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-88.png"" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>""Hummingbird"" places greater emphasis on natural language queries,
considering context and meaning over individual keywords.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over time, search engines have become more and more ""semantic"" or logic-
driven. An unnaturally high keyword density (keyword stuffing) once a viable
SEO strategy, is now blackhat (illegal.)</p>
<p>This is true for all <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/search-
engines/"">search engines</a> (not just Google.)</p>
<h2>Best Practice</h2>
<ul>
<li>Aim For 1-3% Keyword Density to start</li>
<li>Put Keywords In The Right Places (Keyword Placement)</li>
<li>Use Various LSI Keyword Variations</li>
<li>Target Multiple Keywords (Keyword Clustering)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Aim For 1-3% Keyword Density if unsure</h3>
<p>Before those big Google updates, it was common to see high-ranking content
with keyword densities as high as 50%.</p>
<p>That's definitely not going to fly today.</p>
<p><strong>You want to aim for a keyword density of 1-3%</strong> to start, but like all
things in SEO this can vary from keyword to keywords, and certainly from
industry to industry.</p>
<p>That's a rate of 1-3 keywords per 100 words.</p>
<p>However, if you want to take a more advanced (and frankly better approach) you
will want to analyze the top ranking URLs for any given keyword and see what
their average keyword density is. Then, sculpt yours to fit in somewhere in
the middle. Blend in. Always blend.</p>
<p><a href=""https://en-
au.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/"">Popular WordPress SEO plugin Yoast</a> recommends 0.5% to 3%.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-91.png"" /></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-92.png"" /></p>
<p><a href=""https://wordpress.org/plugins/seo-by-rank-math/"">RankMath</a> (another plugin)
says 1% to 2.5%.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-94.png"" /></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-93.png"" /></p>
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyword_density"">The Wikipedia article on keyword
density</a> suggests 1-3%.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-95-1024x510-1.png"" /></p>
<p>The key really, is to not focus on keyword density. You should be prioritizing
writing useful content that helps your readers.</p>
<p>If you do this, naturally your keyword density will fall between 1-3%.</p>
<p>Long-tail keywords are obviously going to be used less than short-tail
keywords.</p>
<p>How often do you think you can use ""how to create a wordpress website""
compared to ""wordpress website.""</p>
<p><strong>Again, the key is naturally flowing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> A 1-3% keyword density is an optimal baseline, but the KEY is
to <strong>blend in</strong>.</p>
<h3>Put Keywords In The Right Places (Keyword Placement)</h3>
<p>These days, it's not really how many times you use keywords, but where you put
them.</p>
<p>There are a number of critical places you must have keywords featured.</p>
<p><strong>These include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Page Title (Title Tags)</li>
<li>H1 Header (Headline)</li>
<li>Subheader (H2, H3)</li>
<li>Meta Description (Meta Tags)</li>
<li>Image Alt-Text </li>
<li>Image Filename</li>
<li>URL Slug</li>
</ul>
<h4>Page Title (Title Tags)</h4>
<p>The page title — also known as title tags — is the most important place to
have a keyword.</p>
<p>In case you didn't know, the page title is the title of your webpage on SERPs
(search engine results pages.)</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-96.png"" /></p>
<p>It's what tells search engine users exactly what your webpage is about — just
like a headline of an article.</p>
<p>Google (and other search engines) will look at the title tags and see if you
have a keyword here. Make sure you do so, and front-loaded if possible.</p>
<h4>H1 Header (Headline)</h4>
<p>You'll also want to put a keyword within your h1 header — this is your actual
page headline.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-99-1024x480-1.png"" /></p>
<p>The h1 header is often confused with the <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/title-tags/"">page
title</a> — it's important to know the
difference.</p>
<p>The page title is the headline for your webpage on the SERP.</p>
<p>The h1 header is an HTML element on your webpage designated by an HTML tag</p>
<h1>, that basically tells Google ""hey, this is the primary topic of this
article"".

Internal links are hyperlinks that link to another page on the same website.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-124.png)

This is typically a link to another webpage on your website. It can however,
be a link to other media files such as images or documents.

## Why Are Internal Links Important For SEO?

The simple answer ⁠— **Internal links help create a better website
architecture**.

Website architecture is how well all the webpages of a website are structured
(linked) together.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-129.png)

It's important for [SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/what-is-seo) because
[search engine crawlers](https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/) (like
Googlebot) have to navigate your website.

They start at your homepage, and work their way down through the category
pages and onto the content.

 **A good architecture** makes it easier for Googlebot to crawl your website.
When you make crawling easy, your webpages will get indexed and ranked. They
will appear on [Google](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors).

It also makes it easy for link juice (link equity) to be passed all throughout
your website.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-130.png)

Link juice helps your individual webpages achieve [higher rankings on
Google](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/) (and other search
engines.)

 **A bad architecture** confuses Googlebot, it can't reach certain pages ⁠—
like dead-end roads. These pages will not get crawled, indexed or ranked. They
won't appear on Google.

 **Internal links = better website architecture = more indexed and higher
ranking webpages**

This isn't just theory either — internal links are proven to improve SEO.

[One case study from Ninja Outreach](https://ninjaoutreach.com/internal-
linking-case-study/) showed a 41.86% increase in organic traffic (site-wide.)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-127.png)

## Best Practices

  * Feature Keywords In Anchor Text
  * Always Dofollow Internal Links (Avoid Nofollow)
  * Do It Manually (No Plugins/Automation)
  * Avoid Using The Same Anchor Text (For Different Pages)
  * Audit Your Internal Links (With Google Search Console)
  * Update Old Pages (With New Internal Links)
  * Links Open In New Window
  * Feature An Internal Link In Post Intro
  * Internally Link From Your Homepage
  * Don't Overdo It

### Feature Keywords In Anchor Text

You'll want to feature a [keyword](https://devinschumacher.com/seo-keywords/)
in some of the anchor texts of your internal links.

FYI — The [anchor text](https://devinschumacher.com/anchor-text/) of a
hyperlink is the text the link is attached to.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-134-1024x517-1.png)

Keyword anchor texts can help give [search
engines](https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines) a better idea about what
the linked page is about.

Google even recommends keyword anchor texts in its [SEO starter
guide](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en).

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-132-1024x125-1.png)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-133-1024x649-1.png)

You'll notice a lot of our internal links have keywords linking back to posts.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-135-1024x407-1.png)

Only use keyword anchor texts if it's relevant — it's perfectly fine having
internal links without keywords as anchors.

 **Takeaway:** Use some keywords in your anchor texts of your internal links.

### Always Dofollow Internal Links (Avoid Nofollow)

You need to make sure that all your internal links have
**""[dofollow](https://devinschumacher.com/do-follow-links/)"" attributes**.

The dofollow attribute is something you can add to your hyperlink HTML.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-137.png)

A dofollow attribute says to Google (and other search engines) ""please follow
this link and pass link equity.""

Conversely, a **""nofollow"" attribute** does the opposite.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-136.png)

99.99% of the time you'll always want internal links to be dofollow.

 **Takeaway:** Make sure your internal links are ""dofollow"" and not
""nofollow.""

### Do It Manually (No Plugins/Automation)

You'll want to make sure you avoid using plugins or automation software for
your internal links.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-147.png)

 **Do them manually.**

There are a few reasons why you shouldn't use a plugin.

  1. They insert internal links randomly
  2. They do not account for user experience
  3. They can accidentally ""nofollow"" the links

Internal links aren't just for transferring PageRank (link equity) — user
experience is also critical.

 **Takeaway:** Avoid using an automation plugin for your internal links.

### Avoid Using The Same Anchor Text (For Different Pages)

Never use the same anchor text for different pages you are internally linking.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-138.png)

It sends mixed signals to Google (and other search engines.)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-140.png)

It'll make them think the two pages are the same topic — this is not good.

Ideally, you want to use anchor texts that are unique, even when the pages are
similar.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-141.png)

**Takeaway:** Don't use the same anchor text for two separate pages.

### Audit Your Internal Links (With Google Search Console)

It's important that you audit your internal links a few times a year.

To do this, you'll want to use [Google Search
Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/welcome).

It has a links feature — you can audit your internal links with it.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-143.png)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-144-1024x636-1.png)

You'll be able to see which pages the majority of your internal links are
pointed at.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-145.png)

Naturally your homepage and main category pages (about, blog, contact, etc...)
will have the most.

This is important for good navigation for both user experience and search
engine crawlers.

Aside from those pages, you'll want to make certain your best and highest-
priority content are getting lots of internal links.

Look at how Brian Dean of Backlinko prioritizes his top content with a horde
of internal links.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-146.png)

Remember — internal links act as roads for link equity to boost your pages in
content.

The more roads, the better (good quality ones only, though.)

 **Takeaway:** Use Google Search Console to audit which pages your internal
links are going to.

### Update Old Pages (With New Internal Links)

When you make new content, it creates internal link opportunities for old
content.

You'll want to go back and look at old posts — you should be able to find
spots to insert new internal links.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-149.png)

This'll bring more link equity ranking power to your newer pages, helping them
rank well.

The [On-Page SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo) post mentions
internal links — this is a good opportunity.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-148-1024x397-1.png)

You will want to continually scan your old content as you make new content.
There will be plenty of internal link opportunities arising.

**Takeaway:** Go back to old content and find spots for internal links to new
content.

### Links Open In New Window

You should make sure that all your links — internal or external — open in a
new window.

This is what we do at SERP Co — every link I create in these posts open in a
new window.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-150.png)

 **We do this because it creates a better user experience.**

Internal links act as additional context and information to a post. When you
open one, you don't want to lose your place on the initial piece of content.

Think of it as a bookmark.

Now it needs to be said — **this does not apply for ALL links on your
website.**

For example, you wouldn't want your homepage and category pages opening new
windows.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-152.png)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-151-1024x480-1.png)

Navigation is their purpose — we are more talking about links in your content.

 **Takeaway:** Make sure all your links in your content ""open in a new tab.""

### Feature An Internal Link In Post Intro

A good strategy to make your internal links more effective, is to put them in
your intro.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-154-1024x358-1.png)

This is a method that Brian Dean of Backlinko came up with.

He says it has helped increased dwell time and decreased bounce rate.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-153.png)

Here's an example of how he uses it.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-155.png)

It seems to be an effective way of keeping people on your website, and not
back to Google.

 **Takeaway:** Put some internal links in your post intros.

### Internally Link From Your Homepage

Another good strategy is to link from your homepage.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-156-1024x480-1.png)

Your homepage is the gateway for search engine crawlers (such as Googlebot) to
your website.

It's the page that gets the most ranking power — a few internal links
funneling to content can make a huge difference.

Look at how we do it here at SERP Co.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-157-1024x480-1.png)

Make sure its important, high-priority content you are linking.

 **Takeaway:** Use some internal links on your homepage to important content.

### Don't Overdo It

Last but not least, make sure you don't use too many internal links.

Using too many internal links on a page can dilute the link equity it passes
to other pages.

Remember — we want to be strategic with our internal links. We want to
prioritize important pages on our website.

 **Keep total links on a page (internal and external) under 100.**

This is what Google has recommended in the past.

Matt Cutts (Google's former head of web spam) made a [blog
post](https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/how-many-links-per-page/) detailing this
recommendation.

He said the reason (to keep links under 100 per page) is user experience.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-158-1024x159-1.png)

> If you're showing well over 100 links per page, you could be overwhelming
> your users and giving them a bad experience.

He also goes over how too many links spreads your ranking power (being passed
through links) thin.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-159-1024x203-1.png)

> If you end up with hundreds of links on a page, Google might choose not to
> follow or to index all those links. At any rate, you’re dividing the
> PageRank of that page between hundreds of links, so each link is only going
> to pass along a minuscule amount of PageRank anyway.

FYI — PageRank is the Google algorithm name for link equity/juice.

 **Takeaway:** Keep total links per page (internal and external) under 100.

## Final Thoughts

In this post we covered what internal links are, how they affect SEO and 10
best practice guidelines to follow.

Internal links are crucial for creating a road map for search engines to
crawl, index and rank your website.

When you use them (internal links) correctly, more pages of your website will
appear on Google. They will rank higher too, due to the added link equity.

<p>Internal links are hyperlinks that link to another page on the same website.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-124.png"" /></p>
<p>This is typically a link to another webpage on your website. It can however,
be a link to other media files such as images or documents.</p>
<h2>Why Are Internal Links Important For SEO?</h2>
<p>The simple answer ⁠— <strong>Internal links help create a better website
architecture</strong>.</p>
<p>Website architecture is how well all the webpages of a website are structured
(linked) together.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-129.png"" /></p>
<p>It's important for <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/what-is-seo"">SEO</a> because
<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/"">search engine crawlers</a> (like
Googlebot) have to navigate your website.</p>
<p>They start at your homepage, and work their way down through the category
pages and onto the content.</p>
<p><strong>A good architecture</strong> makes it easier for Googlebot to crawl your website.
When you make crawling easy, your webpages will get indexed and ranked. They
will appear on <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors"">Google</a>.</p>
<p>It also makes it easy for link juice (link equity) to be passed all throughout
your website.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-130.png"" /></p>
<p>Link juice helps your individual webpages achieve <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/"">higher rankings on
Google</a> (and other search
engines.)</p>
<p><strong>A bad architecture</strong> confuses Googlebot, it can't reach certain pages ⁠—
like dead-end roads. These pages will not get crawled, indexed or ranked. They
won't appear on Google.</p>
<p><strong>Internal links = better website architecture = more indexed and higher
ranking webpages</strong></p>
<p>This isn't just theory either — internal links are proven to improve SEO.</p>
<p><a href=""https://ninjaoutreach.com/internal-
linking-case-study/"">One case study from Ninja Outreach</a> showed a 41.86% increase in organic traffic (site-wide.)</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-127.png"" /></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-126.png"" /></p>
<h2>Best Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li>Feature Keywords In Anchor Text</li>
<li>Always Dofollow Internal Links (Avoid Nofollow)</li>
<li>Do It Manually (No Plugins/Automation)</li>
<li>Avoid Using The Same Anchor Text (For Different Pages)</li>
<li>Audit Your Internal Links (With Google Search Console)</li>
<li>Update Old Pages (With New Internal Links)</li>
<li>Links Open In New Window</li>
<li>Feature An Internal Link In Post Intro</li>
<li>Internally Link From Your Homepage</li>
<li>Don't Overdo It</li>
</ul>
<h3>Feature Keywords In Anchor Text</h3>
<p>You'll want to feature a <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/seo-keywords/"">keyword</a>
in some of the anchor texts of your internal links.</p>
<p>FYI — The <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/anchor-text/"">anchor text</a> of a
hyperlink is the text the link is attached to.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-134-1024x517-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Keyword anchor texts can help give <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines"">search
engines</a> a better idea about what
the linked page is about.</p>
<p>Google even recommends keyword anchor texts in its <a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en"">SEO starter
guide</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-132-1024x125-1.png"" /></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-133-1024x649-1.png"" /></p>
<p>You'll notice a lot of our internal links have keywords linking back to posts.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-135-1024x407-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Only use keyword anchor texts if it's relevant — it's perfectly fine having
internal links without keywords as anchors.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Use some keywords in your anchor texts of your internal links.</p>
<h3>Always Dofollow Internal Links (Avoid Nofollow)</h3>
<p>You need to make sure that all your internal links have
<strong>""<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/do-follow-links/"">dofollow</a>"" attributes</strong>.</p>
<p>The dofollow attribute is something you can add to your hyperlink HTML.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-137.png"" /></p>
<p>A dofollow attribute says to Google (and other search engines) ""please follow
this link and pass link equity.""</p>
<p>Conversely, a <strong>""nofollow"" attribute</strong> does the opposite.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-136.png"" /></p>
<p>99.99% of the time you'll always want internal links to be dofollow.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Make sure your internal links are ""dofollow"" and not
""nofollow.""</p>
<h3>Do It Manually (No Plugins/Automation)</h3>
<p>You'll want to make sure you avoid using plugins or automation software for
your internal links.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-147.png"" /></p>
<p><strong>Do them manually.</strong></p>
<p>There are a few reasons why you shouldn't use a plugin.</p>
<ol>
<li>They insert internal links randomly</li>
<li>They do not account for user experience</li>
<li>They can accidentally ""nofollow"" the links</li>
</ol>
<p>Internal links aren't just for transferring PageRank (link equity) — user
experience is also critical.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Avoid using an automation plugin for your internal links.</p>
<h3>Avoid Using The Same Anchor Text (For Different Pages)</h3>
<p>Never use the same anchor text for different pages you are internally linking.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-138.png"" /></p>
<p>It sends mixed signals to Google (and other search engines.)</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-140.png"" /></p>
<p>It'll make them think the two pages are the same topic — this is not good.</p>
<p>Ideally, you want to use anchor texts that are unique, even when the pages are
similar.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-141.png"" /></p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Don't use the same anchor text for two separate pages.</p>
<h3>Audit Your Internal Links (With Google Search Console)</h3>
<p>It's important that you audit your internal links a few times a year.</p>
<p>To do this, you'll want to use <a href=""https://search.google.com/search-console/welcome"">Google Search
Console</a>.</p>
<p>It has a links feature — you can audit your internal links with it.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-143.png"" /></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-144-1024x636-1.png"" /></p>
<p>You'll be able to see which pages the majority of your internal links are
pointed at.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-145.png"" /></p>
<p>Naturally your homepage and main category pages (about, blog, contact, etc...)
will have the most.</p>
<p>This is important for good navigation for both user experience and search
engine crawlers.</p>
<p>Aside from those pages, you'll want to make certain your best and highest-
priority content are getting lots of internal links.</p>
<p>Look at how Brian Dean of Backlinko prioritizes his top content with a horde
of internal links.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-146.png"" /></p>
<p>Remember — internal links act as roads for link equity to boost your pages in
content.</p>
<p>The more roads, the better (good quality ones only, though.)</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Use Google Search Console to audit which pages your internal
links are going to.</p>

Search intent is what someone is looking for when they use a [search
engine](https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/) (like Google.)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-160.png)

It is also referred to as user intent, or
[keyword](https://devinschumacher.com/seo-keywords) intent.

Search intent is their primary objective — the purpose for why they're using
[Google](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors). That purpose can
be various different things — directions to a restaurant, reviews for a pair
of shoes or even information about a famous person.

There are 4 general types of search intent — we'll cover this in a second.

 **But first, there is one thing we need to be very clear about.**

Search intent is not the same as search query.

 **Search Intent ⁠** — What they are looking for when they use Google

 **Search Query** ⁠— What they type into Google

These two things don't always line up. Ideally they should, which is what
Google aims for.

## The 4 Types Of Search Intent

 **There are 4 basic types of search intent.**

  1. Informational
  2. Navigational
  3. Commercial
  4. Transactional

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image.png)source:
backlinko

### Informational

**Informational search intent** is when an individual is looking for
information. This might be about something simple, or something that is rather
in-depth.

 **Good search query examples include:**

  * ""NBA scores""
  * ""Who is Donald Trump?""
  * ""Directions to LAX airport""
  * ""How do cryptocurrencies work?""

Informational queries are considered more ""Top of the funnel"" keywords. They
are terms that people search when they are new/early in their buying journey.

Informational queries are a great opportunity to educate potential consumers
about their issues, while giving them a first impression with your brand.

If you can help answer some of the questions people have at the top of the
funnel, you will have an opportunity to nurture that relationship down through
their buying journey and potentially sell them something at the end.

### Navigational

 **Navigational search intent** is when someone is looking for a specific
website/webpage. Instead of typing the specific URL, they simply Google search
it.

**Good search query examples include:**

  * ""Twitter""
  * ""YouTube login""
  * ""SERP Co SERP University""

If someone is looking for a Brand's specific property (like Twitter) or URL
(like the login page) there is not much value in a keyword like that. You have
already done the hard work of getting your brand in the consumers mind.

### Commercial

 **Commercial search intent** is when someone is researching a product or
service to buy. They are looking at reviews and comparisons — they are
weighing up their options.

 **Good search query examples include:**

  * ""Netflix vs hulu""
  * ""Samsung galaxy s10 review""
  * ""Best chinese food in los angeles""

These can be seen as ""Middle of the Funnel"" keywords.

A consumer is already educated about their PROBLEM, and fairly knowledgable
about some of the potential solutions on the market - the products & brands
that can help them solve their issue.

Many times these are even ""Bottom of the funnel"" keywords - because the people
searching them are actually quite close to making a purchase decision. For
example - if you are searching for ""Best chinese food in los angeles"" you
might be in your car, hungry, ready to eat and just waiting for the first 4
star reviewed place to pop up so you can click ""get directions"".

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-6.gif)

### Transactional

 **Transactional search intent** is when someone knows what they want to buy
and is ready to make a purchase. They'll enter a search query into Google,
trying to find a place to buy.

**Good search query examples include:**

  * ""Buy iphone 11""
  * ""NBA league pass coupon""
  * ""Converse chuck taylors cheap""

These are often called ""money keywords"" and are referred to as ""Bottom of the
funnel"" or ""high buyer intent"".

Why? Because the people searching these have basically already decided in
their mind that they what they want to buy, and they are ready to pull the
trigger.

## Why Is Search Intent Important For SEO?

Search intent is important because Google (and other search engines) value it
when ranking webpages.

[Google's own mission statement](https://about.google/intl/en/) confirms this.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-1.png)

> Our mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally
> accessible and useful.

The key word there, is **useful**.

Google wants its search results to be useful, to actually be what people are
looking for. They want search queries and search intent to match.

They even have an entire section about search intent in their [search quality
evaluator
guidelines](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf).

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-2-1024x494-1.png)

Google also released this report — [How Intent Is Redefining The Marketing
Funnel](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/search-intent-marketing-
funnel/#/).

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-3-1024x599-1.png)

It's an interesting read. It really shows you how much Google values what
search users are looking for.

If anything, simply ranking for your keywords, showing up on SERPs is not
enough. What good is it being ranked #1 on Google, if it's not what they're
looking for?

**Traffic is nice, but it's not really worth anything on its own.**

It has to translate to something.

Content that doesn't satisfy search intent won't last long at the top. Google
is big on user signals, like bounce rate and dwell time.

## Best Practice

  * Find Out What Search Intent Type Your Keywords Are
  * Analyze The SERP Ranking History Of Your Keywords
  * Optimize Your Content For User Experience
  * Analyze The ""People Also Ask"" Box
  * Analyze Top-Ranking Pages 
  * Don't Forget About Commercial Pages

### Find Out What Search Intent Type Your Keywords Are

Some of your keywords intent will be obvious — ""buy converse chuck taylors"" is
clearly transactional. Alternatively ""how to write a poem"" would be
informational.

The clue is in the wording.

Here's a graph of keyword ""modifiers"" that'll help you identify search intent.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-4.png)source;
ahrefs

If your keyword features one of these modifiers, its user intent should be
clear.

 **Another easy way you can uncover keyword intent is to investigate the
SERPs.**

Now, obviously, the top results for your keyword are going to satisfy search
intent. How could they not? You can't rank that high without doing so.

Type your keyword into Google and observe the results — we'll use ""best seo
tool"" as an example.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-5-1024x504-1.png)

Each top result is a piece of content about the best
[seo](https://devinschumacher.com/what-is-seo) tools. People who type this
search query into google are researching. They want to find out what the best
option is.

**This suggests a commercial intent.**

But if we look at the results for ""backlink checker"" we get different results.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-7-1024x504-1.png)

The results are all actual tools, not content write-ups about ""what is the
best tool.""

 **The search intent here is clearly transactional.**

Another thing to look out for on results pages are **SERP Features**.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-1024x491-1.png)

SERP features are special results that appear on results pages — usually at
the top or side of the page.

They act as a way for search results to be more in-depth, and enticing to
click on.

 **There are 4 main types of SERP features.**

  * Rich Snippets

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-12.png)

  * Paid Results

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-13.png)

  * Universal Results

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-14.png)

  * Knowledge Graphs

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-15.png)

The [on-page SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/#17-serp-features)
post covers SERP features in-depth, you can read more there.

Use this graph to help you match the SERP feature with keyword intent.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-9.png)source:
ahrefs

The Beats headphones example from above clearly has a transactional intent.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11.png)

Using these methods (observation, modifiers, SERP analysis) should be enough
to discover search intent.

 **Takeaway:** Use observation, modifiers or SERP analysis to uncover search
intent.

### Analyze The SERP Ranking History Of Your Keywords

The reality is that SERPs are always changing. You can analyze it to uncover
user intent, but it's just one snapshot in time.

 **You need to look at the SERP ranking history of your keywords.**

To do this, we'll use [Ahrefs' Keyword Explorer
tool](https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer).

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-17.png)

Enter your keyword into the tool, and scroll down to the ""SERP position
history"" section.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-19.png)

The example in the image (how to write a resume) show extremely consistent
results. This tells us that the current SERP ranking is authentic. Search
intent is clear.

Compare that to the results for ""mercury.""

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-21.png)

The ranking history is highly variable, always changing. It's hard to gauge
keyword intent from this.

On the other hand, this presents an opportunity. Google hasn't found the right
results it wants. You can shoot up the rankings with the right strategy.

Most results are going to be somewhere in-between the two examples above.

Take ""notre dame"" for example.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-22.png)

In these instances, you'll want to focus on the consistent results. In the
above example, it's the green and purple lines.

These will give you the best idea about user intent in moderate cases.

 **Takeaway:** Use ahrefs Keyword Explorer tool to analyze your keywords SERP
history.

### Optimize Your Content For User Experience

User experience is extremely important when it comes to your content. How do
you think Google discovers search intent?

User signals.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-23.png)

Google watches what search users do — when they click on a result, do they
stay there? Or do they leave instantly?

Bounce rate, click-through rate, pogo-sticking, dwell time — these are all
measurements Google tracks, and use to determine search intent.

If your content is not optimized for user experience, you're bounce rate is
going to be high, dwell time low. You're not going to rank very well.

 **There are 4 things we are going to address to improve user experience.**

  * Minimize Popups
  * Avoid Small Font Sizes
  * Use Subheadings
  * Don't Forget Videos & Images

#### Minimize Popups

Popups can be extremely intrusive, absolutely ruining the user experience of
your content.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-26.png)

It's best to just avoid them altogether.

**However, exit-intent popups are fine.**

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-24.png)

Exit-intent popups are popups that appear when you move your cursor to exit
the page.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-25-1024x525-1.png)

They are naturally less intrusive than all other forms of popups.

#### Avoid Small Font Sizes

Really small font size can absolutely ruin user experience. How can you expect
someone to read something they can't see?

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-27.png)

No but seriously — look at how hard this is to read.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-30.png)

Now compare it to this — a much larger font size.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-31.png)

Much easier to read.

So what size do you want to use?

According to a [2016
study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301935601_Make_It_Big_The_Effect_of_Font_Size_and_Line_Spacing_on_Online_Readability),
18 points font size. In pixels that's 24.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-28.png)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-29.png)

The truth is, there are lots of studies/research saying all sorts of font
sizes. The main constant however, is avoiding a size that's too small.

Test out your font size yourself. Ask yourself, ""is this hard to read?"" Show
it to a family member or friend.

#### Use Subheadings

Subheadings make your content easy to navigate, easy to understand.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-54-1024x532-1.png)

Like chapters in a book, the content is sliced and diced into different
sections.

 **Pro tip: combine subheadings with a table of contents for maximum content
navigation.**

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-32-1024x343-1.png)

#### Don't Forget Videos & Images

Videos and images are a great way to increase your contents readability.

 **They do this in 2 ways.**

  1. Break up walls of text
  2. Show information through an effective medium

Long walls of text are very hard to read — images and videos act as a way to
break them up.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-35-1024x567-1.png)

Images are also highly effective as a way to show information.

 **Here are 4 statistics backing this up.**

  1. Our brains process images 60,000x faster than text ([source](http://www.t-sciences.com/news/humans-process-visual-data-better).)
  2. It only takes our brains 13 milliseconds to process images ([source](https://rocketium.com/academy/impact-visual-content-marketing/).)
  3. 90% of the information processed by the human brain is visual ([source](http://www.t-sciences.com/news/humans-process-visual-data-better).)
  4. 80% of humans remember what they see, opposed to 10% of what they hear and 20% of what they read ([source](https://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/925-image-stats.html).)

The age-old saying ""a picture is worth a thousand words"" is true.

And as far as videos go, they're a whole bunch of images. They work even
better.

 **Takeaway:** Optimize your content for user experience by minimizing popups,
using the right font size, using subheadings, images and videos.

### Analyze The ""People Also Ask"" Box

The ""People Also Ask"" box SERP feature is a goldmine for content ideas.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-36-1024x563-1.png)

These are actual questions people want answers to when they type your keyword
into Google. This is more than just analyzing the SERP results to uncover user
intent — these are SPECIFIC questions.

Adding these questions to our content will help satisfy search intent greatly,
skyrocketing you up the rankings.

Look at how I've covered some of these questions for ""search intent"" in this
post.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-38.png)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

 **NOTE: Not all questions (from the box) should be used.**

When you click on the questions, more and more will appear. They tend to
become more random and irrelevant as the list goes on.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-43.png)

Focus on the questions at the top.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-44.png)

 **Takeaway:** Insert questions and answers from the ""people also ask"" box
into your content.

### Analyze Top-Ranking Pages

Nothing helps you optimize your content for search intent like looking at
who's winning.

Google tends to want a very specific type of content when it comes to
keywords.

Check out this example — ""on-page seo.""

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-45-1024x504-1.png)

Notice anything? All the top-results are actionable guides. This is the
specific type of content to make for this keyword — this is the content that
satisfies search intent.

 **Ahrefs actually has a case study about this keyword (on-page seo.)**

They had originally created a study for their on-page seo post.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-46-1024x504-1.png)

It didn't rank well. What was wrong?

They didn't satisfy search intent. All the top-results were actionable guides,
so they redid the post.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-47-1024x504-1.png)

Doing this resulted in a 3,100% increase in traffic.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-48.png)source: ahrefs

The post now ranks top 10.

Looking at the top results is not just for uncovering search intent. It's also
useful for discovering what type of content Google wants.

 **Takeaway:** Take content ideas from the top-ranking pages for your keyword.

### Don't Forget About Commercial Pages

It's not all just about content — you also need to optimize your commercial
pages.

Lots of Google searches are looking for these commercial pages. Someone might
be trying to buy something, or wanting to sign-up for a free trial. Maybe even
just get a quote.

Here's an example — ""nike roshe.""

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-49-1024x531-1.png)

No content results, all commercial pages.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-53.png)

If you want to rank for this keyword, don't make a blog post. Make an
e-commerce product page.

Now you're probably thinking... ""Duh, of course commercial pages would come up
for a search query like that.""

True — a product name google search is most likely going to result in pages to
buy said product.

**But not always.**

Take ""air fryer"" for example.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-51.png)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-52.png)

See that? Content results.

Never presume. Always research search intent. If you don't, you might spend
days on a piece of content that doesn't have a snowballs chance at ranking.

## Final Thoughts

Search intent is the reason why people use Google — the primary objective. It
can be to buy something, to get directions to somewhere, or even just
information on something.

It's so important for SEO because it's important to Google. They care about
what search users want. Knowing how to optimize for it is crucial.

In this post we covered all you need to know about search intent.

University](http://serpuniversity.com/).","<h2>What Is Search Intent?</h2>
<p>Search intent is what someone is looking for when they use a <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/"">search
engine</a> (like Google.)</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-160.png"" /></p>
<p>It is also referred to as user intent, or
<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/seo-keywords"">keyword</a> intent.</p>
<p>Search intent is their primary objective — the purpose for why they're using
<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors"">Google</a>. That purpose can
be various different things — directions to a restaurant, reviews for a pair
of shoes or even information about a famous person.</p>
<p>There are 4 general types of search intent — we'll cover this in a second.</p>
<p><strong>But first, there is one thing we need to be very clear about.</strong></p>
<p>Search intent is not the same as search query.</p>
<p><strong>Search Intent ⁠</strong> — What they are looking for when they use Google</p>
<p><strong>Search Query</strong> ⁠— What they type into Google</p>
<p>These two things don't always line up. Ideally they should, which is what
Google aims for.</p>
<h2>The 4 Types Of Search Intent</h2>
<p><strong>There are 4 basic types of search intent.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Informational</li>
<li>Navigational</li>
<li>Commercial</li>
<li>Transactional</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image.png"" />source:
backlinko</p>
<h3>Informational</h3>
<p><strong>Informational search intent</strong> is when an individual is looking for
information. This might be about something simple, or something that is rather
in-depth.</p>
<p><strong>Good search query examples include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>""NBA scores""</li>
<li>""Who is Donald Trump?""</li>
<li>""Directions to LAX airport""</li>
<li>""How do cryptocurrencies work?""</li>
</ul>
<p>Informational queries are considered more ""Top of the funnel"" keywords. They
are terms that people search when they are new/early in their buying journey.</p>
<p>Informational queries are a great opportunity to educate potential consumers
about their issues, while giving them a first impression with your brand.</p>
<p>If you can help answer some of the questions people have at the top of the
funnel, you will have an opportunity to nurture that relationship down through
their buying journey and potentially sell them something at the end.</p>
<h3>Navigational</h3>
<p><strong>Navigational search intent</strong> is when someone is looking for a specific
website/webpage. Instead of typing the specific URL, they simply Google search
it.</p>
<p><strong>Good search query examples include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>""Twitter""</li>
<li>""YouTube login""</li>
<li>""SERP Co SERP University""</li>
</ul>
<p>If someone is looking for a Brand's specific property (like Twitter) or URL
(like the login page) there is not much value in a keyword like that. You have
already done the hard work of getting your brand in the consumers mind.</p>
<h3>Commercial</h3>
<p><strong>Commercial search intent</strong> is when someone is researching a product or
service to buy. They are looking at reviews and comparisons — they are
weighing up their options.</p>
<p><strong>Good search query examples include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>""Netflix vs hulu""</li>
<li>""Samsung galaxy s10 review""</li>
<li>""Best chinese food in los angeles""</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be seen as ""Middle of the Funnel"" keywords.</p>
<p>A consumer is already educated about their PROBLEM, and fairly knowledgable
about some of the potential solutions on the market - the products &amp; brands
that can help them solve their issue.</p>
<p>Many times these are even ""Bottom of the funnel"" keywords - because the people
searching them are actually quite close to making a purchase decision. For
example - if you are searching for ""Best chinese food in los angeles"" you
might be in your car, hungry, ready to eat and just waiting for the first 4
star reviewed place to pop up so you can click ""get directions"".</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-6.gif"" /></p>
<h3>Transactional</h3>
<p><strong>Transactional search intent</strong> is when someone knows what they want to buy
and is ready to make a purchase. They'll enter a search query into Google,
trying to find a place to buy.</p>
<p><strong>Good search query examples include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>""Buy iphone 11""</li>
<li>""NBA league pass coupon""</li>
<li>""Converse chuck taylors cheap""</li>
</ul>
<p>These are often called ""money keywords"" and are referred to as ""Bottom of the
funnel"" or ""high buyer intent"".</p>
<p>Why? Because the people searching these have basically already decided in
their mind that they what they want to buy, and they are ready to pull the
trigger.</p>
<h2>Why Is Search Intent Important For SEO?</h2>
<p>Search intent is important because Google (and other search engines) value it
when ranking webpages.</p>
<p><a href=""https://about.google/intl/en/"">Google's own mission statement</a> confirms this.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-1.png"" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally
accessible and useful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key word there, is <strong>useful</strong>.</p>
<p>Google wants its search results to be useful, to actually be what people are
looking for. They want search queries and search intent to match.</p>
<p>They even have an entire section about search intent in their <a href=""https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en//searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf"">search quality
evaluator
guidelines</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-2-1024x494-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Google also released this report — <a href=""https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/search-intent-marketing-
funnel/#/"">How Intent Is Redefining The Marketing
Funnel</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-3-1024x599-1.png"" /></p>
<p>It's an interesting read. It really shows you how much Google values what
search users are looking for.</p>
<p>If anything, simply ranking for your keywords, showing up on SERPs is not
enough. What good is it being ranked #1 on Google, if it's not what they're
looking for?</p>
<p><strong>Traffic is nice, but it's not really worth anything on its own.</strong></p>
<p>It has to translate to something.</p>
<p>Content that doesn't satisfy search intent won't last long at the top. Google
is big on user signals, like bounce rate and dwell time.</p>
<h2>Best Practice</h2>
<ul>
<li>Find Out What Search Intent Type Your Keywords Are</li>
<li>Analyze The SERP Ranking History Of Your Keywords</li>
<li>Optimize Your Content For User Experience</li>
<li>Analyze The ""People Also Ask"" Box</li>
<li>Analyze Top-Ranking Pages </li>
<li>Don't Forget About Commercial Pages</li>
</ul>
<h3>Find Out What Search Intent Type Your Keywords Are</h3>
<p>Some of your keywords intent will be obvious — ""buy converse chuck taylors"" is
clearly transactional. Alternatively ""how to write a poem"" would be
informational.</p>
<p>The clue is in the wording.</p>
<p>Here's a graph of keyword ""modifiers"" that'll help you identify search intent.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-4.png"" />source;
ahrefs</p>
<p>If your keyword features one of these modifiers, its user intent should be
clear.</p>
<p><strong>Another easy way you can uncover keyword intent is to investigate the
SERPs.</strong></p>
<p>Now, obviously, the top results for your keyword are going to satisfy search
intent. How could they not? You can't rank that high without doing so.</p>
<p>Type your keyword into Google and observe the results — we'll use ""best seo
tool"" as an example.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-5-1024x504-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Each top result is a piece of content about the best
<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/what-is-seo"">seo</a> tools. People who type this
search query into google are researching. They want to find out what the best
option is.</p>
<p><strong>This suggests a commercial intent.</strong></p>
<p>But if we look at the results for ""backlink checker"" we get different results.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-7-1024x504-1.png"" /></p>
<p>The results are all actual tools, not content write-ups about ""what is the
best tool.""</p>
<p><strong>The search intent here is clearly transactional.</strong></p>
<p>Another thing to look out for on results pages are <strong>SERP Features</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-8-1024x491-1.png"" /></p>
<p>SERP features are special results that appear on results pages — usually at
the top or side of the page.</p>
<p>They act as a way for search results to be more in-depth, and enticing to
click on.</p>
<p><strong>There are 4 main types of SERP features.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rich Snippets</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-12.png"" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Paid Results</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-13.png"" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Universal Results</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-14.png"" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge Graphs</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-15.png"" /></p>
<p>The <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/#17-serp-features"">on-page SEO</a>
post covers SERP features in-depth, you can read more there.</p>
<p>Use this graph to help you match the SERP feature with keyword intent.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-9.png"" />source:
ahrefs</p>
<p>The Beats headphones example from above clearly has a transactional intent.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11.png"" /></p>
<p>Using these methods (observation, modifiers, SERP analysis) should be enough
to discover search intent.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Use observation, modifiers or SERP analysis to uncover search
intent.</p>
<h3>Analyze The SERP Ranking History Of Your Keywords</h3>
<p>The reality is that SERPs are always changing. You can analyze it to uncover
user intent, but it's just one snapshot in time.</p>
<p><strong>You need to look at the SERP ranking history of your keywords.</strong></p>
<p>To do this, we'll use <a href=""https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer"">Ahrefs' Keyword Explorer
tool</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-17.png"" /></p>
<p>Enter your keyword into the tool, and scroll down to the ""SERP position
history"" section.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-19.png"" /></p>
<p>The example in the image (how to write a resume) show extremely consistent
results. This tells us that the current SERP ranking is authentic. Search
intent is clear.</p>
<p>Compare that to the results for ""mercury.""</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-21.png"" /></p>
<p>The ranking history is highly variable, always changing. It's hard to gauge
keyword intent from this.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this presents an opportunity. Google hasn't found the right
results it wants. You can shoot up the rankings with the right strategy.</p>
<p>Most results are going to be somewhere in-between the two examples above.</p>
<p>Take ""notre dame"" for example.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-22.png"" /></p>
<p>In these instances, you'll want to focus on the consistent results. In the
above example, it's the green and purple lines.</p>
<p>These will give you the best idea about user intent in moderate cases.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Use ahrefs Keyword Explorer tool to analyze your keywords SERP
history.</p>
<h3>Optimize Your Content For User Experience</h3>
<p>User experience is extremely important when it comes to your content. How do
you think Google discovers search intent?</p>
<p>User signals.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-23.png"" /></p>
<p>Google watches what search users do — when they click on a result, do they
stay there? Or do they leave instantly?</p>
<p>Bounce rate, click-through rate, pogo-sticking, dwell time — these are all
measurements Google tracks, and use to determine search intent.</p>
<p>If your content is not optimized for user experience, you're bounce rate is
going to be high, dwell time low. You're not going to rank very well.</p>
<p><strong>There are 4 things we are going to address to improve user experience.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Minimize Popups</li>
<li>Avoid Small Font Sizes</li>
<li>Use Subheadings</li>
<li>Don't Forget Videos &amp; Images</li>
</ul>
<h4>Minimize Popups</h4>
<p>Popups can be extremely intrusive, absolutely ruining the user experience of
your content.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-26.png"" /></p>
<p>It's best to just avoid them altogether.</p>
<p><strong>However, exit-intent popups are fine.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-24.png"" /></p>
<p>Exit-intent popups are popups that appear when you move your cursor to exit
the page.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-25-1024x525-1.png"" /></p>
<p>They are naturally less intrusive than all other forms of popups.</p>
<h4>Avoid Small Font Sizes</h4>
<p>Really small font size can absolutely ruin user experience. How can you expect
someone to read something they can't see?</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-27.png"" /></p>
<p>No but seriously — look at how hard this is to read.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-30.png"" /></p>
<p>Now compare it to this — a much larger font size.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-31.png"" /></p>
<p>Much easier to read.</p>
<p>So what size do you want to use?</p>
<p>According to a <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301935601_Make_It_Big_The_Effect_of_Font_Size_and_Line_Spacing_on_Online_Readability"">2016
study</a>,
18 points font size. In pixels that's 24.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-28.png"" /></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-29.png"" /></p>
<p>The truth is, there are lots of studies/research saying all sorts of font
sizes. The main constant however, is avoiding a size that's too small.</p>
<p>Test out your font size yourself. Ask yourself, ""is this hard to read?"" Show
it to a family member or friend.</p>
<h4>Use Subheadings</h4>
<p>Subheadings make your content easy to navigate, easy to understand.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-54-1024x532-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Like chapters in a book, the content is sliced and diced into different
sections.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip: combine subheadings with a table of contents for maximum content
navigation.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-32-1024x343-1.png"" /></p>
<h4>Don't Forget Videos &amp; Images</h4>
<p>Videos and images are a great way to increase your contents readability.</p>
<p><strong>They do this in 2 ways.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Break up walls of text</li>
<li>Show information through an effective medium</li>
</ol>
<p>Long walls of text are very hard to read — images and videos act as a way to
break them up.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-35-1024x567-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Images are also highly effective as a way to show information.</p>
<p><strong>Here are 4 statistics backing this up.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Our brains process images 60,000x faster than text (<a href=""http://www.t-sciences.com/news/humans-process-visual-data-better"">source</a>.)</li>
<li>It only takes our brains 13 milliseconds to process images (<a href=""https://rocketium.com/academy/impact-visual-content-marketing/"">source</a>.)</li>
<li>90% of the information processed by the human brain is visual (<a href=""http://www.t-sciences.com/news/humans-process-visual-data-better"">source</a>.)</li>
<li>80% of humans remember what they see, opposed to 10% of what they hear and 20% of what they read (<a href=""https://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/925-image-stats.html"">source</a>.)</li>
</ol>
<p>The age-old saying ""a picture is worth a thousand words"" is true.</p>
<p>And as far as videos go, they're a whole bunch of images. They work even
better.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Optimize your content for user experience by minimizing popups,
using the right font size, using subheadings, images and videos.</p>
<h3>Analyze The ""People Also Ask"" Box</h3>
<p>The ""People Also Ask"" box SERP feature is a goldmine for content ideas.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-36-1024x563-1.png"" /></p>
<p>These are actual questions people want answers to when they type your keyword
into Google. This is more than just analyzing the SERP results to uncover user
intent — these are SPECIFIC questions.</p>
<p>Adding these questions to our content will help satisfy search intent greatly,
skyrocketing you up the rankings.</p>
<p>Look at how I've covered some of these questions for ""search intent"" in this
post.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-38.png"" /></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-37-1024x559-1.png"" /></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-39.png"" /></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-41.png"" /></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-42-1024x567-1.png"" /></p>
<p><strong>NOTE: Not all questions (from the box) should be used.</strong></p>
<p>When you click on the questions, more and more will appear. They tend to
become more random and irrelevant as the list goes on.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-43.png"" /></p>
<p>Focus on the questions at the top.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-44.png"" /></p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Insert questions and answers from the ""people also ask"" box
into your content.</p>
<h3>Analyze Top-Ranking Pages</h3>
<p>Nothing helps you optimize your content for search intent like looking at
who's winning.</p>
<p>Google tends to want a very specific type of content when it comes to
keywords.</p>
<p>Check out this example — ""on-page seo.""</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-45-1024x504-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Notice anything? All the top-results are actionable guides. This is the
specific type of content to make for this keyword — this is the content that
satisfies search intent.</p>
<p><strong>Ahrefs actually has a case study about this keyword (on-page seo.)</strong></p>
<p>They had originally created a study for their on-page seo post.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-46-1024x504-1.png"" /></p>
<p>It didn't rank well. What was wrong?</p>
<p>They didn't satisfy search intent. All the top-results were actionable guides,
so they redid the post.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-47-1024x504-1.png"" /></p>
<p>Doing this resulted in a 3,100% increase in traffic.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-48.png"" />source: ahrefs</p>
<p>The post now ranks top 10.</p>
<p>Looking at the top results is not just for uncovering search intent. It's also
useful for discovering what type of content Google wants.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Take content ideas from the top-ranking pages for your keyword.</p>
<h3>Don't Forget About Commercial Pages</h3>
<p>It's not all just about content — you also need to optimize your commercial
pages.</p>
<p>Lots of Google searches are looking for these commercial pages. Someone might
be trying to buy something, or wanting to sign-up for a free trial. Maybe even
just get a quote.</p>
<p>Here's an example — ""nike roshe.""</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-49-1024x531-1.png"" /></p>
<p>No content results, all commercial pages.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-53.png"" /></p>
<p>If you want to rank for this keyword, don't make a blog post. Make an
e-commerce product page.</p>
<p>Now you're probably thinking... ""Duh, of course commercial pages would come up
for a search query like that.""</p>
<p>True — a product name google search is most likely going to result in pages to
buy said product.</p>
<p><strong>But not always.</strong></p>
<p>Take ""air fryer"" for example.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-51.png"" /></p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-52.png"" /></p>
<p>See that? Content results.</p>
<p>Never presume. Always research search intent. If you don't, you might spend
days on a piece of content that doesn't have a snowballs chance at ranking.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Search intent is the reason why people use Google — the primary objective. It
can be to buy something, to get directions to somewhere, or even just
information on something.</p>
<p>It's so important for SEO because it's important to Google. They care about
what search users want. Knowing how to optimize for it is crucial.</p>
<p>In this post we covered all you need to know about search intent.</p>

A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers (such as Googlebot) not to
crawl a page of a website. It's basically a text file that gives instructions
to Google.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mXXfDh9fO0OdbgdI4rQLdg-
riZkgv7y9b39oZ105ZWpSobchMn_EWa6GSosFGV4Z31mgC-4OBnhnyff2Tv8ITVVjiBoNu_VELewxq9uuuCUEGJO1u_mPcVEwqyqSUbWDg42njwCM)source:
keyCDN

For a more ""technical"" definition, here's how Wikipedia defines it.

>  _The robots exclusion standard, also known as the robots exclusion protocol
> or simply robots.txt, is a standard used by websites to communicate with web
> crawlers and other web robots. The standard specifies how to inform the web
> robot about which areas of the website should not be processed or scanned.
> _

 **NOTE:** All major search engines (Google, Bing, Yahoo) accept robots.txt
requests.

## What Are Robots In SEO?

Robots is another name for search engine crawlers. They can also be referred
to as spiders or bots.

These ""robots"" crawl websites, indexing information they uncover.

 **In the robots.txt file, robots are known as ""user-agents.""**

There is no universal user-agent name — each search engine has its own name
for its robots. Google's is called Googlebot. You would have to put the unique
robots name into your robots.txt file.

You can however use an **asterisk (*)** to target all search engine robots.
More on this later…

You can use the[ robots.txt website
database](https://www.robotstxt.org/db.html) to find the names of each search
engines robots.

 **Robots =** search engine crawlers (Googlebot for example)

 **Robots.txt =** a text file with instructions for robots

## Anatomy of a Robots.txt File

The robots.txt file starts with a basic format.

User-agent: X  
Disallow: Y

 **User-agent:** identifies what search engine crawler the instructions are
for.

 **Disallow:** These are instructions for what page/area of a website the
user-agent should ignore (not crawl.)

Let's try an example.

User-agent: Googlebot  
Disallow: /wp-admin/

This robots.txt file is telling Google's crawler to not crawl the /wp-admin/
path of the website.

 **There are some other important rules to know.**

User-agent: *

Using an asterisk (*) will target ALL search engine crawlers.

Disallow: /

Using only a slash (/) will block ALL of your website.

You can see a full breakdown of all the different rules with[ Google's Useful
robots.txt
rules](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062596?hl=en&ref_topic=6061961).

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/wRIlrgeOCu9s0-9xW8afDg4HSgaLLYdsWxgOFYFx1KBDydzFrMw6dAIVekIZOEvMgUd5ksmLPDzz5hIt1kdewAqhujxOOc0odL4whPlqZ1o4q-T4bWk1SVSEwNDNkuedrXlV1AfK)

 **We should cover specific aspects of robots.txt more extensively.**

### User-agent

Each of the major search engines have unique user-agent name for their search
crawlers. These include:

  * Googlebot (Google)
  * BingBot (Bing)
  * Slurp (Yahoo)

Multiple user-agents can exist in a robots.txt file — it looks like this.

User-agent: Googlebot  
Disallow: /images  
  
User-agent: BingBot  
Disallow: /junk

All the instructions (disallow, allow, crawl-delay) between the first user-
agent and the second one, are for the first one. In the example above,
Googlebot would be instructed to ""disallow"" /images. BingBot would crawl
/images, but not /junk.

 **Remember:** using the asterisk (*) makes the robots.txt directives
applicable to ALL search engine crawlers.

### Disallow

The disallow directive tells search engine robots not to crawl specific
regions of your website. These can be specific files, pages or general sub-
directories.

You have to specify a ""path"" for the disallow directive to take effect. Here's
an example doing so.

User-agent: *  
Disallow: /images

The path in the example above is **/images** — this tells specified user-
agents to not crawl this area of the website.

If you do not specify a path, nothing will be disallowed.

 **Remember:** Using the slash (/) will block the entire website.

### Allow

The allow directive does the opposite of the disallow directive. It exists
because there are instances where you'd want to disallow a section of your
website, but ""allow"" an individual element. You might want to block all
images, except one.

Here's an example.

User-agent: *  
Disallow: /images  
Allow: /images/image01.jpg

The example above has told all search engines to not crawl all your images,
except **image01.jpg**.

If you do not specify a path for the allow directive, nothing will happen, it
will be ignored.

### Sitemap

Robots.txt files can also gives directions to the XML sitemap of a website.

 **FYI:** An XML sitemap is file that lists all the URLs of your website. It
makes crawling of your website easier for search engines.

Here's an example of how sitemaps are used in a robots.txt file.

User-agent: *  
Disallow: /images  
Sitemap: https://www.staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/sitemap1.xml

This would lead all crawlers to your XML sitemap. Make sure that enter a full
URL, like in the example above.

The sitemap directive is supported by all 3 of the big search engines: Google,
Yahoo and Bing.

 **NOTE:** You can use more than one XML sitemap in your robots.txt file.

Here's how it would look.

User-agent: *  
Allow: /images  
Sitemap: https://www.staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/sitemap1.xml  
Sitemap: https://www.staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/sitemap2.xml

This robots.txt file would instruct all search engine crawlers directions to
both sitemaps.

### Crawl-delay

The crawl-delay directive — technically an ""unofficial"" directive"" is used to
stop servers being overloaded. Sometimes search engine crawlers can overwhelm
your host server with too many requests.

The crawl-delay directive gives your website's server some breathing room.
It's not a permanent fix — the real problem is your server — this directive is
a short-term solution.

Here's an example of how it's used.

User-agent: *  
Disallow: /images  
Crawl-delay: 10

This robots.txt file targets all search crawlers, blocking your /images path,
with a crawl-delay value of 10.

The crawl-delay directive has a value usually somewhere between 0-30. These
are seconds, as in how many seconds of delay.

Make sure that the crawl-delay directives comes after the disallow/allow
directive/s.

 **IMPORTANT:** The crawl-delay directive is not official, it is only
acknowledge by some search engines.

Google does not support it — instead they have their own crawl delay settings,
accessible through Google Search Console.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-59.png)

Bing and Yahoo do support it, but have their own unique instructions.

  * [Bing instructions](https://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/2012/05/03/to-crawl-or-not-to-crawl-that-is-bingbots-question/)
  * [Yahoo instructions](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/guide-meta-tags-robotstxt-slurp-sln2213.html)

### Comments

You can add comments to your robots.txt file by using a dash (#) before some
text. These comments have absolutely no bearing on what is communicated to
what specified user-agents. They are simply there for humans.

Here is an example.

#This robots.txt file is blocking all images  
User-agent: *  
Disallow: /images

You can also do it another way.

User-agent: * #This robots.txt file is blocking all images  
Disallow: /images

### Formatting

How you format your robots.txt file is extremely important. If you don't
format correctly, you might not communicate to search engines correctly. Hell,
you might not even communicate at all.

You need to make sure that every directive (disallow, allow, sitemap, crawl-
delay) has its own line. Here are some examples.

 **AVOID writing your robots.txt file like this.** **✘**  

User-agent: * Disallow: /images Allow: /Images/Image01.jpg

This will confuse the hell out of robots crawling your website.

 **INSTEAD write it like this.** **✔**  

User-agent: *  
Disallow: /Images  
Allow: /Images/image01.jpg

## How To Create a Robots.txt File

Open up Windows notepad and enter your preferred user-agent/s and directive/s.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/raHV5YrSpBoKrlRhTO0wjAJQbu_VeUfbNA0uBRTDIYbJ_L42WliEmlqTwAezbhvIn_CPk8VsqEnxfCQrrClwDgKPTLSvbjhxBMWIWb8Soj37w_vjJCdk37yVWhjxa9Vl8iDR3yr7)

Save the file — give it ""Robots.txt"" filename.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kbCRCBKF6y85KXIdJbqHRbKEYYKEKl_2pPhU8vRZ7G8NccMOvpJ7FBgr5qGL9k_6hjLi8JXcTUq2L020EJ0Vel77FL45DU8O5154sxJs-
RebOg_Ntsd_wZtuPaU5d8FKqviNdF15)

## Where to Put a Robots.txt File

A robots.txt file is placed at the root of your website — the top-level
directory. This can be done through cPanel.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/vKKIy5C-2M6P3XowOkCX--
_Smg2cckoVhgVdUEZPUq0sz0qqEniCmz0XzgppdQXgq0i8MbvMha1lJc3HvHdg0mCIelrHF725zKvsEa2SWkSX9N4fjfFdnDNOvCzLcxLfThkI8Gny)

The URL will come out looking like this: **https://www.example.com/robot.txt**

Make sure the filename is robots.txt and remember that the URL for the file is
case-sensitive.

It's really important that you get the URL right — search engines ONLY look
for that URL.

For example, if your URL was **https://www.example.com/images/robot.txt** it
wouldn't be found.

## Why You Should Use Robots.txt

Ideally you should always use a robots.txt file. The instructions it gives
search engines makes crawling that much easier (which will mean better SERP
ranking.)

 **However, I'll give you some specific reasons why you'd use a robots.txt
file.**

### Blocking Pages With Sensitive Information

There are certain pages on your website that you DON'T want search engines to
crawl — pages with sensitive information.

 **Common examples might include:**

  * Admin/dashboard pages (/wp-admin/)
  * E-commerce shopping cart pages (/cart/)
  * Script pages (/script/)
  * Common gateway interface pages/folder (/cgi-bin/)
  * Forum community member private pages

Make sure you use the disallow directive on any pages with potentially
sensitive information.

### Maximizing Crawl Budget

Using a robots.txt file can help optimize your crawl budget.

Crawl budget is an SEO term for the amount of resources search engines use
when crawling your website.

You see, there are millions of websites out there that need to be crawled.
Google (and other search engines) only have so many resources. They must
choose what pages are important and which aren't.

A robots.txt file can make sure your important pages get crawled, by giving
directives to ignore the irrelevant ones.

### Avoiding Duplicate Content

A robots.txt file with the right directives, can instruct search engine
crawlers to ignore pages with duplicate content.

 **Common types of duplicate content page include:**

  * Printer version of a page
  * E-commerce product descriptions
  * Syndicated content across multiple domains
  * E-commerce category pages

Blocking these pages from search engines will keep your website clean from any
potential SEO penalties.

## Best Practice

  * How to create + where to place
  * Each directive must have its own line
  * One robots.txt file per subdomain
  * Know the rules for different search engines
  * Avoid the byte order mark
  * Don't use the noindex directive
  * Test your robots.txt file with Google Search Console

### How to create + where to place

We covered this earlier, but I'll do so once more quickly.

  1. Open Windows notepad and enter in your user-agent/s and directive/s
  2. Save the text file as ""robots.txt""
  3. Access your website's cPanel and create a new file named ""robots.txt"" at the root of your website
  4. Add the robots.txt text file to the new file named robots.txt

 **NOTE:** Make sure the file you create at the root of your website comes out
with the right URL.

Right URL = example.com/robots.txt

Wrong URL = example.com/images/robots.txt

### Each directive must have its own line

I covered this earlier in the formatting section but we'll go over it again.

 **Each directive in your robots.txt file MUST be on its own line.**

 **Here's an example of how you should write out a robots.txt file. ✔**

User-agent: *  
Disallow: /images  
Allow: /images/image01.jpg

 **Conversely, here's how you shouldn't do it. ✘**

User-agent: * Disallow: /images Allow: /images/image01.jpg

### One robots.txt file per subdomain

If you have multiple subdomains, you will need a robots.txt file for each one.

For example, **https://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud** would have a
robots.txt file URL of **https://devinschumacher.com/robots.txt**.

 **http://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud** would have a different one —
**https://devinschumacher.com/robots.txt**.

This applies for all different variations of your website, ccTLDs included.

### Know the rules for different search engines

Every search engine has their own rules regarding robots.txt files — you need
to know at least the main ones.

For instance: did you know that Google and Bing give priority to the directive
that is the longest?

Here are some examples to help you understand.

User-agent: *  
Disallow: /about/  
Allow: /about/company/

Explanation: All search engines — except Google and Bing — are blocked from
crawling **/about/**. The same is true for **/about/company/** — only Google
and Bing can crawl it.

See that? Because the allow directive is longer and more specific, Google and
Bing prioritize it. It takes precedence over the disallow directive, despite
below it chronologically. Google and Bing are allowed to crawl /about/ because
it comes 2nd to them.

Here's another example.

User-agent: *  
Allow: /about/team/  
Disallow: /about/

Explanation: No search engines, including Google and Bing, can crawl
**/about/**. Everyone can crawl **/about/team/**.

Because the allow directive is both first in chronology and length, it is
prioritized by all search engines. This includes Google and Bing. Because the
disallow directive comes both second in chronology and length, all can crawl.

### Avoid the byte order mark (UTF-8 BOM)

The byte order mark (UTF-8 BOM) is a unicode character that indicates the byte
order of a file. It is entirely invisible to humans and literally serves no
SEO function.

Because it has no bearing on SEO, it's not surprising [Google straight-out
ignores it](https://developers.google.com/search/reference/robots_txt#file-
format).

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-61.png)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/image-62-1024x504-1.png)

If Google ignores it, then why should you even do anything about it?

Because not every search engine is like Google, and it (UTF-8 BOM) has shown
to cause problems.

Sometimes, the byte order mark will ""choke"" the user-agent, causing it to
error. When the user-agent stuffs up, everything else does too.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-64.png)

If you have Notepad++ (it's free) you can select to ""Encode in UTF-8 without
BOM.""

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-63.png)

Textpad (another similar program) has a box you can ""un-tick.""

![Checking for UTF-8 BOM in text editor](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/utf-bom-text-editor-option.jpg)

If you have a robots.txt that you're not sure has UTF-8 BOM, use [W3C
Internalization Checker](http://validator.w3.org/i18n-checker/#validate-by-
upload+) to find out.

### Don't use the noindex directive

Did you know there is a ""noindex"" for the robots.txt file? It's technically
unofficial, but it exists.

Google begrudgingly supported it for a long time, even when they said not to
use it. But [as of September of 2019 they officially stopped supporting
it](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/07/a-note-on-unsupported-rules-in-
robotstxt.html).

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-65.png)

> We're retiring all code that handles unsupported and unpublished rules (such
> as noindex) on September 1, 2019.

Bing is the same — apparently they never supported noindex, according to
Frédéric Dubut (Bing Senior Program Manager Lead)

https://twitter.com/CoperniX/status/1146085846845554688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1146085846845554688&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.contentkingapp.com%2Facademy%2Frobotstxt%2F

Leave noindex for meta tags.

### Test your robots.txt file with Google Search Console

One of the most important things you can do is test your robots.txt file. You
can do this with [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-
console/welcome).

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-66.png)

If your robots.txt has errors, it will let you know.

## Final Thoughts

In this post we covered everything you need to know about the robots.txt file.

The robots.txt file is how you communicate with search engines, instructing
their crawlers with directives. Knowing how the file works, how to write them
and how to optimize them is crucial for SEO.","<h2>What Is a Robots.txt File?</h2>
<p>A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers (such as Googlebot) not to
crawl a page of a website. It's basically a text file that gives instructions
to Google.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mXXfDh9fO0OdbgdI4rQLdg-
riZkgv7y9b39oZ105ZWpSobchMn_EWa6GSosFGV4Z31mgC-4OBnhnyff2Tv8ITVVjiBoNu_VELewxq9uuuCUEGJO1u_mPcVEwqyqSUbWDg42njwCM"" />source:
keyCDN</p>
<p>For a more ""technical"" definition, here's how Wikipedia defines it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>_The robots exclusion standard, also known as the robots exclusion protocol
or simply robots.txt, is a standard used by websites to communicate with web
crawlers and other web robots. The standard specifies how to inform the web
robot about which areas of the website should not be processed or scanned.
_</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> All major search engines (Google, Bing, Yahoo) accept robots.txt
requests.</p>
<h2>What Are Robots In SEO?</h2>
<p>Robots is another name for search engine crawlers. They can also be referred
to as spiders or bots.</p>
<p>These ""robots"" crawl websites, indexing information they uncover.</p>
<p><strong>In the robots.txt file, robots are known as ""user-agents.""</strong></p>
<p>There is no universal user-agent name — each search engine has its own name
for its robots. Google's is called Googlebot. You would have to put the unique
robots name into your robots.txt file.</p>
<p>You can however use an <strong>asterisk (*)</strong> to target all search engine robots.
More on this later…</p>
<p>You can use the<a href=""https://www.robotstxt.org/db.html""> robots.txt website
database</a> to find the names of each search
engines robots.</p>
<p><strong>Robots =</strong> search engine crawlers (Googlebot for example)</p>
<p><strong>Robots.txt =</strong> a text file with instructions for robots</p>
<h2>Anatomy of a Robots.txt File</h2>
<p>The robots.txt file starts with a basic format.</p>
<p>User-agent: X<br />
Disallow: Y</p>
<p><strong>User-agent:</strong> identifies what search engine crawler the instructions are
for.</p>
<p><strong>Disallow:</strong> These are instructions for what page/area of a website the
user-agent should ignore (not crawl.)</p>
<p>Let's try an example.</p>
<p>User-agent: Googlebot<br />
Disallow: /wp-admin/</p>
<p>This robots.txt file is telling Google's crawler to not crawl the /wp-admin/
path of the website.</p>
<p><strong>There are some other important rules to know.</strong></p>
<p>User-agent: *</p>
<p>Using an asterisk (*) will target ALL search engine crawlers.</p>
<p>Disallow: /</p>
<p>Using only a slash (/) will block ALL of your website.</p>
<p>You can see a full breakdown of all the different rules with<a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062596?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6061961""> Google's Useful

</ul>
<h3>User-agent</h3>
<p>Each of the major search engines have unique user-agent name for their search
crawlers. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Googlebot (Google)</li>
<li>BingBot (Bing)</li>
<li>Slurp (Yahoo)</li>
</ul>
<p>Multiple user-agents can exist in a robots.txt file — it looks like this.</p>
<p>User-agent: Googlebot<br />
Disallow: /images  </p>
<p>User-agent: BingBot<br />
Disallow: /junk</p>
<p>All the instructions (disallow, allow, crawl-delay) between the first user-
agent and the second one, are for the first one. In the example above,
Googlebot would be instructed to ""disallow"" /images. BingBot would crawl
/images, but not /junk.</p>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> using the asterisk (*) makes the robots.txt directives
applicable to ALL search engine crawlers.</p>
<h3>Disallow</h3>
<p>The disallow directive tells search engine robots not to crawl specific
regions of your website. These can be specific files, pages or general sub-
directories.</p>
<p>You have to specify a ""path"" for the disallow directive to take effect. Here's
an example doing so.</p>
<p>User-agent: *<br />
Disallow: /images</p>
<p>The path in the example above is <strong>/images</strong> — this tells specified user-
agents to not crawl this area of the website.</p>
<p>If you do not specify a path, nothing will be disallowed.</p>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Using the slash (/) will block the entire website.</p>
<h3>Allow</h3>
<p>The allow directive does the opposite of the disallow directive. It exists
because there are instances where you'd want to disallow a section of your
website, but ""allow"" an individual element. You might want to block all
images, except one.</p>
<p>Here's an example.</p>
<p>User-agent: *<br />
Disallow: /images<br />
Allow: /images/image01.jpg</p>
<p>The example above has told all search engines to not crawl all your images,
except <strong>image01.jpg</strong>.</p>
<p>If you do not specify a path for the allow directive, nothing will happen, it
will be ignored.</p>
<h3>Sitemap</h3>
<p>Robots.txt files can also gives directions to the XML sitemap of a website.</p>
<p><strong>FYI:</strong> An XML sitemap is file that lists all the URLs of your website. It
makes crawling of your website easier for search engines.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how sitemaps are used in a robots.txt file.</p>
<p>User-agent: *<br />
Disallow: /images<br />
Sitemap: https://www.staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/sitemap1.xml</p>
<p>This would lead all crawlers to your XML sitemap. Make sure that enter a full
URL, like in the example above.</p>
<p>The sitemap directive is supported by all 3 of the big search engines: Google,
Yahoo and Bing.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You can use more than one XML sitemap in your robots.txt file.</p>
<p>Here's how it would look.</p>
<p>User-agent: *<br />
Allow: /images<br />
Sitemap: https://www.staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/sitemap1.xml<br />
Sitemap: https://www.staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud/sitemap2.xml</p>
<p>This robots.txt file would instruct all search engine crawlers directions to
both sitemaps.</p>
<h3>Crawl-delay</h3>
<p>The crawl-delay directive — technically an ""unofficial"" directive"" is used to
stop servers being overloaded. Sometimes search engine crawlers can overwhelm
your host server with too many requests.</p>
<p>The crawl-delay directive gives your website's server some breathing room.
It's not a permanent fix — the real problem is your server — this directive is
a short-term solution.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how it's used.</p>
<p>User-agent: *<br />
Disallow: /images<br />
Crawl-delay: 10</p>
<p>This robots.txt file targets all search crawlers, blocking your /images path,
with a crawl-delay value of 10.</p>
<p>The crawl-delay directive has a value usually somewhere between 0-30. These
are seconds, as in how many seconds of delay.</p>
<p>Make sure that the crawl-delay directives comes after the disallow/allow
directive/s.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The crawl-delay directive is not official, it is only
acknowledge by some search engines.</p>
<p>Google does not support it — instead they have their own crawl delay settings,
accessible through Google Search Console.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-59.png"" /></p>
<p>Bing and Yahoo do support it, but have their own unique instructions.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/2012/05/03/to-crawl-or-not-to-crawl-that-is-bingbots-question/"">Bing instructions</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://help.yahoo.com/kb/guide-meta-tags-robotstxt-slurp-sln2213.html"">Yahoo instructions</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>You can add comments to your robots.txt file by using a dash (#) before some
text. These comments have absolutely no bearing on what is communicated to
what specified user-agents. They are simply there for humans.</p>
<p>Here is an example.</p>
<h1>This robots.txt file is blocking all images</h1>
<p>User-agent: *<br />
Disallow: /images</p>
<p>You can also do it another way.</p>
<p>User-agent: * #This robots.txt file is blocking all images<br />
Disallow: /images</p>
<h3>Formatting</h3>
<p>How you format your robots.txt file is extremely important. If you don't
format correctly, you might not communicate to search engines correctly. Hell,
you might not even communicate at all.</p>
<p>You need to make sure that every directive (disallow, allow, sitemap, crawl-
delay) has its own line. Here are some examples.</p>
<p><strong>AVOID writing your robots.txt file like this.</strong> <strong>✘</strong>  </p>
<p>User-agent: * Disallow: /images Allow: /Images/Image01.jpg</p>
<p>This will confuse the hell out of robots crawling your website.</p>
<p><strong>INSTEAD write it like this.</strong> <strong>✔</strong>  </p>
<p>User-agent: *<br />
Disallow: /Images<br />
Allow: /Images/image01.jpg</p>
<h2>How To Create a Robots.txt File</h2>
<p>Open up Windows notepad and enter your preferred user-agent/s and directive/s.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/raHV5YrSpBoKrlRhTO0wjAJQbu_VeUfbNA0uBRTDIYbJ_L42WliEmlqTwAezbhvIn_CPk8VsqEnxfCQrrClwDgKPTLSvbjhxBMWIWb8Soj37w_vjJCdk37yVWhjxa9Vl8iDR3yr7"" /></p>
<p>Save the file — give it ""Robots.txt"" filename.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kbCRCBKF6y85KXIdJbqHRbKEYYKEKl_2pPhU8vRZ7G8NccMOvpJ7FBgr5qGL9k_6hjLi8JXcTUq2L020EJ0Vel77FL45DU8O5154sxJs-
RebOg_Ntsd_wZtuPaU5d8FKqviNdF15"" /></p>
<h2>Where to Put a Robots.txt File</h2>
<p>A robots.txt file is placed at the root of your website — the top-level
directory. This can be done through cPanel.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/vKKIy5C-2M6P3XowOkCX--
_Smg2cckoVhgVdUEZPUq0sz0qqEniCmz0XzgppdQXgq0i8MbvMha1lJc3HvHdg0mCIelrHF725zKvsEa2SWkSX9N4fjfFdnDNOvCzLcxLfThkI8Gny"" /></p>
<p>The URL will come out looking like this: <strong>https://www.example.com/robot.txt</strong></p>
<p>Make sure the filename is robots.txt and remember that the URL for the file is
case-sensitive.</p>
<p>It's really important that you get the URL right — search engines ONLY look
for that URL.</p>
<p>For example, if your URL was <strong>https://www.example.com/images/robot.txt</strong> it
wouldn't be found.</p>
<h2>Why You Should Use Robots.txt</h2>
<p>Ideally you should always use a robots.txt file. The instructions it gives
search engines makes crawling that much easier (which will mean better SERP
ranking.)</p>
<p><strong>However, I'll give you some specific reasons why you'd use a robots.txt
file.</strong></p>
<h3>Blocking Pages With Sensitive Information</h3>
<p>There are certain pages on your website that you DON'T want search engines to
crawl — pages with sensitive information.</p>
<p><strong>Common examples might include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Admin/dashboard pages (/wp-admin/)</li>
<li>E-commerce shopping cart pages (/cart/)</li>
<li>Script pages (/script/)</li>
<li>Common gateway interface pages/folder (/cgi-bin/)</li>
<li>Forum community member private pages</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you use the disallow directive on any pages with potentially
sensitive information.</p>
<h3>Maximizing Crawl Budget</h3>
<p>Using a robots.txt file can help optimize your crawl budget.</p>
<p>Crawl budget is an SEO term for the amount of resources search engines use
when crawling your website.</p>
<p>You see, there are millions of websites out there that need to be crawled.
Google (and other search engines) only have so many resources. They must
choose what pages are important and which aren't.</p>
<p>A robots.txt file can make sure your important pages get crawled, by giving
directives to ignore the irrelevant ones.</p>
<h3>Avoiding Duplicate Content</h3>
<p>A robots.txt file with the right directives, can instruct search engine
crawlers to ignore pages with duplicate content.</p>
<p><strong>Common types of duplicate content page include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Printer version of a page</li>
<li>E-commerce product descriptions</li>
<li>Syndicated content across multiple domains</li>
<li>E-commerce category pages</li>
</ul>
<p>Blocking these pages from search engines will keep your website clean from any
potential SEO penalties.</p>
<h2>Best Practice</h2>
<ul>
<li>How to create + where to place</li>
<li>Each directive must have its own line</li>
<li>One robots.txt file per subdomain</li>
<li>Know the rules for different search engines</li>
<li>Avoid the byte order mark</li>
<li>Don't use the noindex directive</li>
<li>Test your robots.txt file with Google Search Console</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to create + where to place</h3>
<p>We covered this earlier, but I'll do so once more quickly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Windows notepad and enter in your user-agent/s and directive/s</li>
<li>Save the text file as ""robots.txt""</li>
<li>Access your website's cPanel and create a new file named ""robots.txt"" at the root of your website</li>
<li>Add the robots.txt text file to the new file named robots.txt</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure the file you create at the root of your website comes out
with the right URL.</p>
<p>Right URL = example.com/robots.txt</p>
<p>Wrong URL = example.com/images/robots.txt</p>
<h3>Each directive must have its own line</h3>
<p>I covered this earlier in the formatting section but we'll go over it again.</p>
<p><strong>Each directive in your robots.txt file MUST be on its own line.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Here's an example of how you should write out a robots.txt file. ✔</strong></p>
<p>User-agent: *<br />
Disallow: /images<br />
Allow: /images/image01.jpg</p>
<p><strong>Conversely, here's how you shouldn't do it. ✘</strong></p>
<p>User-agent: * Disallow: /images Allow: /images/image01.jpg</p>
<h3>One robots.txt file per subdomain</h3>
<p>If you have multiple subdomains, you will need a robots.txt file for each one.</p>
<p>For example, <strong>https://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud</strong> would have a
robots.txt file URL of <strong>https://devinschumacher.com/robots.txt</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>http://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud</strong> would have a different one —
<strong>https://devinschumacher.com/robots.txt</strong>.</p>
<p>This applies for all different variations of your website, ccTLDs included.</p>
<h3>Know the rules for different search engines</h3>
<p>Every search engine has their own rules regarding robots.txt files — you need
to know at least the main ones.</p>
<p>For instance: did you know that Google and Bing give priority to the directive
that is the longest?</p>
<p>Here are some examples to help you understand.</p>
<p>User-agent: *<br />
Disallow: /about/<br />
Allow: /about/company/</p>
<p>Explanation: All search engines — except Google and Bing — are blocked from
crawling <strong>/about/</strong>. The same is true for <strong>/about/company/</strong> — only Google
and Bing can crawl it.</p>
<p>See that? Because the allow directive is longer and more specific, Google and
Bing prioritize it. It takes precedence over the disallow directive, despite
below it chronologically. Google and Bing are allowed to crawl /about/ because
it comes 2nd to them.</p>
<p>Here's another example.</p>
<p>User-agent: *<br />
Allow: /about/team/<br />
Disallow: /about/</p>
<p>Explanation: No search engines, including Google and Bing, can crawl
<strong>/about/</strong>. Everyone can crawl <strong>/about/team/</strong>.</p>
<p>Because the allow directive is both first in chronology and length, it is
prioritized by all search engines. This includes Google and Bing. Because the
disallow directive comes both second in chronology and length, all can crawl.</p>
<h3>Avoid the byte order mark (UTF-8 BOM)</h3>
<p>The byte order mark (UTF-8 BOM) is a unicode character that indicates the byte
order of a file. It is entirely invisible to humans and literally serves no

<p>If Google ignores it, then why should you even do anything about it?</p>
<p>Because not every search engine is like Google, and it (UTF-8 BOM) has shown
to cause problems.</p>

-->",https://devinschumacher.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=15322&action=edit,,,,,"**The Google Dance** : Welcome to one of the most annoying (but exciting)
things in SEO.

The Google Dance refers to the high amount of volatility that a new asset
(website, webpage, etc.) on your website experiences while Google is trying to
determine what position to ultimately place it on its index.

Simple as that.

Put another way, the Google Dance is when Google is beginning to notice your
page & gives it a chance in the [SERPs](https://devinschumacher.com/serp/)
(SERP = Search Engine Results Page).

I like to think of it like Google coming up to me and saying (in its best
[Captain Falcon impression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlTFADCkNe8))
""Show me your moves!""

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/show-me-your-moves-
google-dance-1024x576-1.jpg)

What this means practically, is that your newly published page that starts
very low in the search engines (maybe like position 100?) will get bumped way
up overnight to a higher position so Google can see how its users react.

If Google's algorithm sees that people are clicking on your page, spending
time on it, and enjoying the content they see, it will give you some kudos on
that page and [factor that in to its final determination on where to
rank](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/) you.

Another way to put this, is Google changes the rank of your page (without any
other [ranking factors](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/)
being affected) just to see what happens.

Aka Google lets you have your day in the sun.

And then usually after a day, it will come crashing back down the SERPs.

Then it will come skyrocketing back up.

Then back down.

And the cycle continues for a while.

Your page bounces up and down the SERPs very volatilely until Google can
determine where it should ""fairly"" rank it.

And then it will either stay there or slowly trend up/down depending on what
your competitors are doing.

**Here is an example of a site we have been tracking for a while that was
doing a crazy Google Dance before finally stabilizing:**

page, new [link building](https://devinschumacher.com/link-building/)
campaign, new anything) **volatility is normal**.

Let me say that again.

Volatility = Normal.

Didn't think you were gonna have to do math while reading this post did you?
Well, you did. One simple equation.

## Volatility = Normal.

Volatility is normal, and it's actually volatility is GOOD.

It's a sign that your website is getting some attention from ""The Big G"".

In the rest of this article I am going to go more in-depth about history,
examples & strategy - but don't feel like you need to keep reading to
understand what the Google Dance is, because it's really quite simple:

 _The Google Dance refers to the high amount of volatility that a new asset
(website, page, etc.) on your website experiences while Google is trying to
determine what position to put it in in its index._

## The Old Google Dance

Historically, Google would update its algorithm _periodically_.

These days, Google claims the algorithm updates are pushed _in real-time._

So, the ""old"" Google Dance was the period right after an algo update (usually
3-5 days) when Google would push a major update of its new algorithm into the
live SERPs and watch the entire index dance around.

This would be a period of high volatility.

Like Google musical chairs.

Or for some reason, I instantly imagine that scene in the Disneyland Haunted
Mansion where all the ghosts are dancing.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/disneyland-ghosts-
google-dance-gif.gif)

But as the saying goes, out with the old in the with the new.

For the rest of this article, we are going to discuss the ""new"" Google Dance.

This is what I described in the intro: _""The high amount of volatility that a
new asset (website, page, etc.) on your website experiences while Google is
trying to determine what position to put it in in its index.""_

## Why does the Google Dance happen?

The Google Dance, from our research & experience, is caused (and amplified) by
the following factors:

  *  **Age** : Is it a brand new website or page? (newer = more dancing)
  *  **Competitiveness** : How competitive is the keyword/industry/locale? (more competition = more dancing)
  *  **Link Building** : How much link building are you doing?
    * More/new links: Building new links = more dancing
    * Strength of links: More powerful links = more dancing
  *  **Changes** : Are you making huge changes to the page? (bigger changes = more dancing)
    * Launch a new webpage
    * Launch a new website
    * Website re-design/re-build

## How long does the Google dance last?

Similar to the ""why"" of the Google Dance, the ""how long"" depends on the same
factors.

More competitive terms seem to dance more, and dance (bounce) more
drastically.

Similarly, if your page dances for a while and then stabilizes but does not
land in the position you want (like if the Google Dance stabilized and you end
up on Page 2) then you can re-dance later when you start building links again
to try and get to page one.

## Can I prevent the Google Dance?

No.

Next question.

## Google Dance Examples

Up to this point, we have already provided some interesting examples of the
Google Dance (maybe even very interesting, if I do say so myself).

But, we wanted to give you a few more.

Why?

To hammer home the notion that the Google dance is **normal**. It is
**expected.**

So when your website starts Google Dancing, and you inevitably get that sense
of ""oh sh?t what's happening to my website?!"" and you look like this in front
of your computer:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/oh-shit-the-google-
dance-is-happening-1024x768-1.jpg)

You can take a deep breath, calm down, and remember all these examples we
gave.

Oh, and by the way, these are ALL examples of a website we have ranked (either
for ourselves, or our clients) that gave a heartstopping Google dance, but
then ended up in the top spots of Google.

When the Google Dance happens, just continue to do all the normal things you
would do according to best SEO practices, and don't panic.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download.gif)

 **Don't panic.** And [never leave home without your
towel](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/24779-a-towel-the-hitchhiker-s-guide-
to-the-galaxy-says-is).

## Final Thoughts

 **In summary:**

  * The Google Dance refers to the high amount of volatility that a new asset (website, page, etc.) on your website experiences while Google is trying to determine what position to ultimately place it on its index.
  * The Google Dance is just Google trying to decide if it likes you (your website or webpage).
  * Expect the Google Dance.
  * When the Google Dance happens, just continue to do all the normal things you would do according to best SEO practices, and don't panic.
  * Volatility = Normal.
  * Don't panic.

Now get out there and Google dance like nobody's watching.

things in SEO.</p>
<p>The Google Dance refers to the high amount of volatility that a new asset
(website, webpage, etc.) on your website experiences while Google is trying to
determine what position to ultimately place it on its index.</p>
<p>Simple as that.</p>
<p>Put another way, the Google Dance is when Google is beginning to notice your
page &amp; gives it a chance in the <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/serp/"">SERPs</a>
(SERP = Search Engine Results Page).</p>
<p>I like to think of it like Google coming up to me and saying (in its best
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlTFADCkNe8"">Captain Falcon impression</a>)
""Show me your moves!""</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/show-me-your-moves-
google-dance-1024x576-1.jpg"" /></p>
<p>What this means practically, is that your newly published page that starts
very low in the search engines (maybe like position 100?) will get bumped way
up overnight to a higher position so Google can see how its users react.</p>
<p>If Google's algorithm sees that people are clicking on your page, spending
time on it, and enjoying the content they see, it will give you some kudos on
that page and <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/"">factor that in to its final determination on where to
rank</a> you.</p>
<p>Another way to put this, is Google changes the rank of your page (without any
other <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/"">ranking factors</a>
being affected) just to see what happens.</p>

<p>Aka Google lets you have your day in the sun.</p>
<p>And then usually after a day, it will come crashing back down the SERPs.</p>
<p>Then it will come skyrocketing back up.</p>
<p>Then back down.</p>
<p>And the cycle continues for a while.</p>
<p>Your page bounces up and down the SERPs very volatilely until Google can
determine where it should ""fairly"" rank it.</p>
<p>And then it will either stay there or slowly trend up/down depending on what
your competitors are doing.</p>
<p><strong>Here is an example of a site we have been tracking for a while that was
doing a crazy Google Dance before finally stabilizing:</strong></p>

After all, Google gets over 63,000 searches per SECOND.

And for most people, ""the internet"" is what comes up when you search things in
Google.

However, these results that you see are only what Google has found & _wants to
include_.

Most of the internet is NOT in Google. Why? **Because** :

  * Google doesn't condone it (ex: websites doing illegal things)
  * Google doesn't like it (ex: a website that Google sees as providing no value)
  * The website doesn't want to be there (so it tells the crawler ""hey don't include me"")

This means that these websites are ""un-searchable"".

They cannot be found using a search engine. You have to know the exact website
address to access them.

 **Fun fact** : It is estimated that 96-99% of the entire internet is ""Deep
Web""

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/search-engines-
deep-web.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/search-
engines-deep-web.png)

 _In this article we are going to talk about what a search engine actually is,
how it works, and we will even cover the most popular search engine types &
search engine companies._

## What is a Search Engine?

 **Search Engine Definition** : An internet search engine, or web search
engine, is a web-based [software designed](https://devinschumacher.com/web-
design-software/) to conduct & carry-out an internet search (performed by a
user) on the ""World Wide Web"" based on a set of rules (called an algorithm)
that is intended to bring back a page of search results (called a SERP, for
Search Engine Results Page) that the algorithm ""believes"" will help answer the
users search query (aka question).

Wow that was a mouthful.

Basically, it's a program that brings back a bunch of websites it thinks will
be the absolute best fit to satisfy the reason you typed in your [search
query](https://devinschumacher.com/search-query/) in the first place.

So, when you Google ""How to make a grilled cheese sandwich"" the search engine
is going to look through it's entire index (like the digital version of a
library) and give you a bunch of recipes, videos, pictures, etc.

It doesn't know EXACTLY what you want to know about making a grilled cheese
sandwich, so it will show you what it ""believes"" (they don't actually have
beliefs) will be a good variety of resources that will help you solve your
problem.

## How do Search Engines Work?

Search engines are competitors.

Yahoo is its own company just like Google is its own company and just like
Bing is its own company - they don't come together to decide how a search
engine should work.

They compete.

(although they do come together to make rules about what they want _us_ to do
for them so it's easier on their crawlers to profit off our info.... just
speed read the homepage of [schema.org](http://schema.org) if you don't
believe that)

So, each search engine has a ""secret formula"" (extremely complex mathematical
calculations called an algorithm) that the company has created that it thinks
will deliver the best search results.

Why? Because their customers are searchers.

If they provide good results every time, you will keep coming back.

I stopped using Yahoo a long time ago because it sucks. When I search
something I never get what I really need.

To make things even more complex - these companies are always innovating. They
update their algorithms constantly to continue to improve the results, and so
we (the general public) never really know exactly how it works.

## An Example of How A Search Engine Works

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-google-search-
works.png)

Let me give you an example to illustrate how a search engine works, but also
give you a little diatribe about why the thing that powers my entire agency
(it is named [SERP Co](http://serp.co), after all) is actually one giant
extortion machine.

**Disclaimer** : This is an educational rant, but I will try to keep it short.

Search engines crawl around the World Wide Web by following hyperlinks (aka
""links"").

A link is that clickable thing that takes you somewhere else. [Here is an
example of a link to SERP Co](https://serp.co).

As they [follow links](https://devinschumacher.com/do-follow-links/) they read
everything they can from the page.

They read the HTML, the CSS, Javascript, etc.

So, when you see this:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/what-do-we-see-
vs.-what-a-search-engine-sees-
pt.1-1024x658-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/what-do-we-see-vs.-what-a-search-engine-sees-pt.1.png)

They see this:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/what-do-we-see-
vs.-what-a-search-engine-sees-
pt.2-1024x574-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/what-do-we-see-vs.-what-a-search-engine-sees-pt.2.png)

As they are reading the page they begin to form an ""understanding"" about what
the website as a whole (and the specific pages on it) are about.

When they crawl around & read our website, they can understand they we are a
[digital marketing company (it says it prominently in the HTML of our home
page title tag, and also as the main heading (called
an](https://devinschumacher.com/category/marketing/)

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/what-search-
engines-see-1024x643-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/what-search-engines-see.png)

After the search engine forms an understanding about your website it will
""file it away"" in a large database, called an Index, that acts like a digital
library of all the websites on the internet (that it has crawled).

So, when you perform a search on a search engine, the search engine does not
go out and quickly crawl the entire web for answers, it simply looks up in its
own database to find the closest match to your search query.

## Search Engine Algorithms

So, you want to know **how search engines work** , huh?

  *  **Recommended Reading** : [How Does Google Search Work](https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks)

## How A Traditional Search Engine Algorithm Works

Let's say you search for a [""digital
marketing](https://devinschumacher.com/digital-marketing-for-dummies/) company
in los angeles"", the search engine will look through it's already formed index
and find all the websites it has previously crawled, categorized and included
in its index that are relevant to that search you performed.

Then, it will return ALL the results.

However, each page of search results only has room for 10 organic listings.

So, the search engine must decide ""who should I show 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.""

It does this based on a large variety of [search engine ranking
factors](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/) that help the
search engine determine who is the ""best"" or ""most relevant"" result.

This is really where the algorithm comes into play - the set of rules that
determine how a search engine understands & prioritizes your website.

## Non Traditional Search Engines

Colloquially when we say ""search engine"" most people think of text based
search, like Google.com (a crawler based search engine).

That would be the example we just gave above.

However, with the continual progression of technology we have seen many more
types of search engines (and thus search engine algorithms) arise.

Basically, anything you ""search on"" is a search engine - but it does not
necessarily have the same algorithm as the text based search engine.

Let's get into some examples.

## Examples of Search Engine Algorithms

  * Crawler
  * Directories
  * Meta
  * Hybrids
  * Maps
  * Multimedia
  * Voice
  * Shopping
  * etc.

### Crawler Based Search Engines

Crawler-based search engines use software algorithm / programs to find &
categorize websites & webpages.

They ""crawl"" (kind of like the digital version of clicking on a link) these
links from page to page, and website to website, and begin to make a giant
""web"" of relationships and categorizations.

Hence why these crawlers are called ""crawlers"", or ""spiders"", or ""bots"".

[Web crawlers](https://devinschumacher.com/web-crawlers/) a websites, download
them to their ""index"" & analyze the information so they can appropriately
categorize them (and then display / serve them to a searcher looking for that
kind of information).

When a user searches for something, the search engine checks its ""index"" for
relevant websites that it can provide the user.

The end result of all these ""spiders crawling around"" is a gigantic,
interconnected ""web"" which we call - the World Wide Web, aka internet.

### Examples of Crawler Based Search Engines

  * Google 
  * Yahoo
  * Bing
  * Vivisimo
  * Dogpile
  * Altavista
  * Overture
  * HotBot
  * AlltheWeb
  * AOL
  * Ask.com
  * Blekko
  * Duck Duck Go
  * Excite
  * ExactSeek
  * ePilot
  * ICQ
  * iWon
  * Jayde
  * Kanoodle
  * Kosmix
  * LookSmart
  * Lycos
  * Netscape
  * Open Directory
  * 7Search
  * Teoma
  * WiseNut
  * Yebol

### Directory Search Engines

A directory type of search engine has humans decide which categories the
websites will belong to.

People manually add & organize the websites into categories, check the sites
for quality, determine the ranking, etc. based on a pre-defined set of
evaluations / rules.

### Meta Search Engines

Meta search engines are like a search engine of search engine results - they
take the search results from the other search engines and then combine these
results into one aggregated results page.

Sound a little ridiculous? I think so too, for the most part.

#### Examples of Meta Search Engines

  * Answers.com
  * Clusty
  * DeeperWeb
  * Dogpile
  * Excite
  * Harvester42
  * HotBot
  * Info.com
  * Ixquick
  * Kayak
  * LeapFish
  * Metacrawler
  * Mobissimo
  * Turbo10
  * WebCrawler
  * yolink

### Hybrid Search Engines

Hybrid search engines are a mix of directory based search engines & crawler
based search engines.

### Map Search Engines

Map search engines help users find business locations on a map.

They usually combine user submitted data, algorithmic prioritization, street
views from car video cameras, satellites, user reviews, etc.

### Examples of Map Search Engines

  * [Google Maps](https://devinschumacher.com/google-maps-marketing-strategies/)
  * Apple Maps
  * Bing Maps
  * Waze
  * MapQuest
  * Maps.me
  * Citymapper
  * Here.com

### Multimedia / Image Search Engines

Image / Multimedia search allows multimedia to be searchable by using search
queries in multiple data types.

Because computers are still learning how to understand what an image is, we
can add other layers of data to our multimedia to help it understand,
categorize, etc.

This additional data, called Metadata, can be things like text descriptions,
links to other related content, or even additional ""code markup"", from a set
of descriptive standards, that tell the machines what the image/video/etc.
actually is.

### Examples of Multimedia Search Engines

  * Bing Videos
  * blinkx
  * FindSounds
  * Google Images
  * Google Video
  * Picsearch
  * Podscope
  * ScienceStage
  * Songza
  * TV Genius
  * Veveo
  * TinEye
  * Yahoo! Video
  * YouTube

### Voice Search Engines

Voice search allows us to speak to devices and get feedback in return.

You are probably familiar with this already.

#### Examples of Voice Search Engines

  * Amazon Alexa
  * Google Home
  * Apple's Siri

Although, these still need a bit of work... 😂

https://youtube.com/shorts/k63mkPJprtY?feature=share

### Shopping Search Engines

Shopping search engines help consumers find products.

The most obvious example is Amazon.

They are based off of their own algorithms, product uploads, user reviews,
etc.

### Examples of Shopping Search Engines

  * Amazon
  * Ali Express
  * Bing Shopping
  * Google Shopping
  * Shopping.com
  * ShopWiki
  * Shopzilla

Also acquired by Verizon, AOL is one of the original web based services.

Who still uses AOL as a search engine? I don't personally know anyone - but my
parents still have @aol.com email addresses!

DuckDuckGo is an internet search engine that emphasizes protecting searchers'
privacy and distinguishes itself by showing all users the same search results
for a given search term - emphasizing returning the best search results,
rather than the most results, from over 400 individual sources, including
crowdsourced sites such as Wikipedia, and other search engines like Bing,
Yahoo!, and Yandex. As of August 2019, it had 44,196,092 daily direct searches
on average. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo))

## How Do Search Engines Make Money?

Search engines make money by serving advertisements in line with the ""organic""
results.

Companies can pay the search engine to ""show up"" on Page 1 by paying money to
be there.

They also make money by putting affiliate links inside of search results.

## Final Thoughts

Search engines are where (almost) everywhere goes now to get answers to their
questions, recommendations of businesses, shop for products, learn new skills,
etc.

They run our society & our markets.

If you are a business owner you need to have first page real estate for the
products & services you sell, if you don't you will be missing out on an
astronomical amount of new business.","<p>For most of us when we think ""search engine"" we think Google.</p>
<p>After all, Google gets over 63,000 searches per SECOND.</p>
<p>And for most people, ""the internet"" is what comes up when you search things in
Google.</p>
<p>However, these results that you see are only what Google has found &amp; <em>wants to
include</em>.</p>
<p>Most of the internet is NOT in Google. Why? <strong>Because</strong> :</p>
<ul>
<li>Google doesn't condone it (ex: websites doing illegal things)</li>
<li>Google doesn't like it (ex: a website that Google sees as providing no value)</li>
<li>The website doesn't want to be there (so it tells the crawler ""hey don't include me"")</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that these websites are ""un-searchable"".</p>
<p>They cannot be found using a search engine. You have to know the exact website
address to access them.</p>
<p><strong>Fun fact</strong> : It is estimated that 96-99% of the entire internet is ""Deep
Web""</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/search-
engines-deep-web.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/search-engines-
deep-web.png"" /></a></p>
<p><em>In this article we are going to talk about what a search engine actually is,
how it works, and we will even cover the most popular search engine types &amp;
search engine companies.</em></p>
<h2>What is a Search Engine?</h2>
<p><strong>Search Engine Definition</strong> : An internet search engine, or web search
engine, is a web-based <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/web-
design-software/"">software designed</a> to conduct &amp; carry-out an internet search (performed by a
user) on the ""World Wide Web"" based on a set of rules (called an algorithm)
that is intended to bring back a page of search results (called a SERP, for
Search Engine Results Page) that the algorithm ""believes"" will help answer the
users search query (aka question).</p>
<p>Wow that was a mouthful.</p>
<p>Basically, it's a program that brings back a bunch of websites it thinks will
be the absolute best fit to satisfy the reason you typed in your <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/search-query/"">search
query</a> in the first place.</p>
<p>So, when you Google ""How to make a grilled cheese sandwich"" the search engine
is going to look through it's entire index (like the digital version of a
library) and give you a bunch of recipes, videos, pictures, etc.</p>
<p>It doesn't know EXACTLY what you want to know about making a grilled cheese
sandwich, so it will show you what it ""believes"" (they don't actually have
beliefs) will be a good variety of resources that will help you solve your
problem.</p>
<h2>How do Search Engines Work?</h2>
<p>Search engines are competitors.</p>
<p>Yahoo is its own company just like Google is its own company and just like
Bing is its own company - they don't come together to decide how a search
engine should work.</p>
<p>They compete.</p>
<p>(although they do come together to make rules about what they want <em>us</em> to do
for them so it's easier on their crawlers to profit off our info.... just
speed read the homepage of <a href=""http://schema.org"">schema.org</a> if you don't
believe that)</p>
<p>So, each search engine has a ""secret formula"" (extremely complex mathematical
calculations called an algorithm) that the company has created that it thinks
will deliver the best search results.</p>
<p>Why? Because their customers are searchers.</p>
<p>If they provide good results every time, you will keep coming back.</p>
<p>I stopped using Yahoo a long time ago because it sucks. When I search
something I never get what I really need.</p>
<p>To make things even more complex - these companies are always innovating. They
update their algorithms constantly to continue to improve the results, and so
we (the general public) never really know exactly how it works.</p>
<h2>An Example of How A Search Engine Works</h2>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-google-search-
works.png"" /></p>
<p>Let me give you an example to illustrate how a search engine works, but also
give you a little diatribe about why the thing that powers my entire agency
(it is named <a href=""http://serp.co"">SERP Co</a>, after all) is actually one giant
extortion machine.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> : This is an educational rant, but I will try to keep it short.</p>
<p>Search engines crawl around the World Wide Web by following hyperlinks (aka
""links"").</p>
<p>A link is that clickable thing that takes you somewhere else. <a href=""https://serp.co"">Here is an
example of a link to SERP Co</a>.</p>
<p>As they <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/do-follow-links/"">follow links</a> they read
everything they can from the page.</p>
<p>They read the HTML, the CSS, Javascript, etc.</p>
<p>So, when you see this:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/what-do-we-see-vs.-what-a-search-engine-sees-pt.1.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/what-do-we-see-
vs.-what-a-search-engine-sees-
pt.1-1024x658-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>They see this:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/what-do-we-see-vs.-what-a-search-engine-sees-pt.2.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/what-do-we-see-
vs.-what-a-search-engine-sees-
pt.2-1024x574-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>As they are reading the page they begin to form an ""understanding"" about what
the website as a whole (and the specific pages on it) are about.</p>
<p>When they crawl around &amp; read our website, they can understand they we are a
<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/category/marketing/"">digital marketing company (it says it prominently in the HTML of our home
page title tag, and also as the main heading (called
an</a></p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/what-search-engines-see.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/what-search-
engines-see-1024x643-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>After the search engine forms an understanding about your website it will
""file it away"" in a large database, called an Index, that acts like a digital
library of all the websites on the internet (that it has crawled).</p>
<p>So, when you perform a search on a search engine, the search engine does not
go out and quickly crawl the entire web for answers, it simply looks up in its
own database to find the closest match to your search query.</p>
<h2>Search Engine Algorithms</h2>
<p>So, you want to know <strong>how search engines work</strong> , huh?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recommended Reading</strong> : <a href=""https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks"">How Does Google Search Work</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>How A Traditional Search Engine Algorithm Works</h2>
<p>Let's say you search for a <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/digital-marketing-for-dummies/"">""digital
marketing</a> company
in los angeles"", the search engine will look through it's already formed index
and find all the websites it has previously crawled, categorized and included
in its index that are relevant to that search you performed.</p>
<p>Then, it will return ALL the results.</p>
<p>However, each page of search results only has room for 10 organic listings.</p>
<p>So, the search engine must decide ""who should I show 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.""</p>
<p>It does this based on a large variety of <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/"">search engine ranking
factors</a> that help the
search engine determine who is the ""best"" or ""most relevant"" result.</p>
<p>This is really where the algorithm comes into play - the set of rules that
determine how a search engine understands &amp; prioritizes your website.</p>
<h2>Non Traditional Search Engines</h2>
<p>Colloquially when we say ""search engine"" most people think of text based
search, like Google.com (a crawler based search engine).</p>
<p>That would be the example we just gave above.</p>
<p>However, with the continual progression of technology we have seen many more
types of search engines (and thus search engine algorithms) arise.</p>
<p>Basically, anything you ""search on"" is a search engine - but it does not
necessarily have the same algorithm as the text based search engine.</p>
<p>Let's get into some examples.</p>
<h2>Examples of Search Engine Algorithms</h2>
<ul>
<li>Crawler</li>
<li>Directories</li>
<li>Meta</li>
<li>Hybrids</li>
<li>Maps</li>
<li>Multimedia</li>
<li>Voice</li>
<li>Shopping</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crawler Based Search Engines</h3>
<p>Crawler-based search engines use software algorithm / programs to find &amp;
categorize websites &amp; webpages.</p>
<p>They ""crawl"" (kind of like the digital version of clicking on a link) these
links from page to page, and website to website, and begin to make a giant
""web"" of relationships and categorizations.</p>
<p>Hence why these crawlers are called ""crawlers"", or ""spiders"", or ""bots"".</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/web-crawlers/"">Web crawlers</a> a websites, download
them to their ""index"" &amp; analyze the information so they can appropriately
categorize them (and then display / serve them to a searcher looking for that
kind of information).</p>
<p>When a user searches for something, the search engine checks its ""index"" for
relevant websites that it can provide the user.</p>
<p>The end result of all these ""spiders crawling around"" is a gigantic,
interconnected ""web"" which we call - the World Wide Web, aka internet.</p>
<h3>Examples of Crawler Based Search Engines</h3>
<ul>
<li>Google </li>
<li>Yahoo</li>
<li>Bing</li>
<li>Vivisimo</li>
<li>Dogpile</li>
<li>Altavista</li>
<li>Overture</li>
<li>HotBot</li>
<li>AlltheWeb</li>
<li>AOL</li>
<li>Ask.com</li>
<li>Blekko</li>
<li>Duck Duck Go</li>
<li>Excite</li>
<li>ExactSeek</li>
<li>ePilot</li>
<li>ICQ</li>
<li>iWon</li>
<li>Jayde</li>
<li>Kanoodle</li>
<li>Kosmix</li>
<li>LookSmart</li>
<li>Lycos</li>
<li>Netscape</li>
<li>Open Directory</li>
<li>7Search</li>
<li>Teoma</li>
<li>WiseNut</li>
<li>Yebol</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directory Search Engines</h3>
<p>A directory type of search engine has humans decide which categories the
websites will belong to.</p>
<p>People manually add &amp; organize the websites into categories, check the sites
for quality, determine the ranking, etc. based on a pre-defined set of
evaluations / rules.</p>
<h3>Meta Search Engines</h3>
<p>Meta search engines are like a search engine of search engine results - they
take the search results from the other search engines and then combine these
results into one aggregated results page.</p>
<p>Sound a little ridiculous? I think so too, for the most part.</p>
<h4>Examples of Meta Search Engines</h4>
<ul>
<li>Answers.com</li>
<li>Clusty</li>
<li>DeeperWeb</li>
<li>Dogpile</li>
<li>Excite</li>
<li>Harvester42</li>
<li>HotBot</li>
<li>Info.com</li>
<li>Ixquick</li>
<li>Kayak</li>
<li>LeapFish</li>
<li>Metacrawler</li>
<li>Mobissimo</li>
<li>Turbo10</li>
<li>WebCrawler</li>
<li>yolink</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hybrid Search Engines</h3>
<p>Hybrid search engines are a mix of directory based search engines &amp; crawler
based search engines.</p>
<h3>Map Search Engines</h3>
<p>Map search engines help users find business locations on a map.</p>
<p>They usually combine user submitted data, algorithmic prioritization, street
views from car video cameras, satellites, user reviews, etc.</p>
<h3>Examples of Map Search Engines</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/google-maps-marketing-strategies/"">Google Maps</a></li>
<li>Apple Maps</li>
<li>Bing Maps</li>
<li>Waze</li>
<li>MapQuest</li>
<li>Maps.me</li>
<li>Citymapper</li>
<li>Here.com</li>
</ul>
<h3>Multimedia / Image Search Engines</h3>
<p>Image / Multimedia search allows multimedia to be searchable by using search
queries in multiple data types.</p>
<p>Because computers are still learning how to understand what an image is, we
can add other layers of data to our multimedia to help it understand,
categorize, etc.</p>
<p>This additional data, called Metadata, can be things like text descriptions,
links to other related content, or even additional ""code markup"", from a set
of descriptive standards, that tell the machines what the image/video/etc.
actually is.</p>

<li>TV Genius</li>
<li>Veveo</li>
<li>TinEye</li>
<li>Yahoo! Video</li>
<li>YouTube</li>
</ul>
<h3>Voice Search Engines</h3>
<p>Voice search allows us to speak to devices and get feedback in return.</p>
<p>You are probably familiar with this already.</p>
<h4>Examples of Voice Search Engines</h4>
<ul>
<li>Amazon Alexa</li>
<li>Google Home</li>
<li>Apple's Siri</li>
</ul>
<p>Although, these still need a bit of work... 😂</p>
<p>https://youtube.com/shorts/k63mkPJprtY?feature=share</p>
<h3>Shopping Search Engines</h3>
<p>Shopping search engines help consumers find products.</p>
<p>The most obvious example is Amazon.</p>
<p>They are based off of their own algorithms, product uploads, user reviews,
etc.</p>
<h3>Examples of Shopping Search Engines</h3>

Every true SEO on the planet would give their second born child for a list of
Google's magic formula - every factor, in order of importance, to get their
website to rank on the top of the search engines.

However, it's not that simple.

Google doesn't just give away the recipe to their secret sauce - you have to
know where & how to find them.

So, to save you years of trouble, we have compiled a list of Google's top
ranking factors - the things you'll want to focus on during your search engine
optimization journey to the Holy Grail of SEO - #1 in the
[SERP](https://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud)s (Search Engine Results

 **These ranking factors come from:**

  1. First hand experience working in the field for years
  2. Test results from peers, colleagues, and partners in this industry
  3. Hints from Google's patent filings
  4. Articles from other trusted SEO experts

In addition to providing you with a list of Google's ranking factors, we have
categorized them into manageable groups so they are easier to understand &
conceptualize.

Finally, before we dive into the full list of Google ranking factors, we broke
down the top factors that will help you rank in Google (and other search
engines as well), we wanted to compile just the top ranking factors for all of
you with limited time & resources.

## The Top 10 Google Ranking Factors

These factors, the top 10 things to focus on for maximum SEO impact with
limited resources, come from our personal experience.

Years of testing, experimentation, and research.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/download-10.gif)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/download-10.gif)

If you have ever heard of [the Pareto Principle (aka the 80/20
rule)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) you will understand
that focusing on these top ranking factors will yield the biggest bang for
your buck in SEO.

### 1\. Referring Domains to your Domain (RDD)

The quantity & quality of referring domains (aka other websites) that link to
your domain (aka website) without rel=""nofollow"", rel=""ugc"", rel=""sponsored"".

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/rdd-
definition-1024x205-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/RDD-definition.png)

### 2\. Referring Domains to your Page (RDP)

The quantity & quality of referring domains (aka other websites) that link to
your **specific page** (aka URL) without rel=""nofollow"", rel=""ugc"",
rel=""sponsored"".

Getting links directly to a specific URL/page is an excellent way to boost the
[keyword rankings](https://devinschumacher.com/keyword-rank-tracking-tools/)
that page is indexing for.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/referring_domains_to_page-
url-1024x306-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/referring_domains_to_page-url.png)

### 3\. Keyword in Domain

Getting the primary keyword you are targeting in the root domain will help.

For example, let's say you are trying to rank for ""diet pill reviews"".

  1. **EMD** = Exact match domain (the root domain matches your keyword exactly (aka dietpillreviews.com)
  2.  **PMD** = Partial match domain (the root domain matches your keyword partially (aka thedietpillguy.com)

Having an ""EMD"" or ""PMD"" will help you rank for your desired keyword.

It can also be a problem though if it is not actually your brand name and you
are just using it in your domain to rank - you can easily over-optimize the
rest of the factors on accident.

### 4\. Keyword in URL

If you can't get the keyword in your domain name (understandable) then having
it in your URL will be your next goal.

For example, if your business name is SERP Co but you want to rank for
""[digital marketing for dummies](https://devinschumacher.com/digital-
marketing-for-dummies/)"" it would be best to create an inner page on your
website that is all about that topic:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/digital_marketing_for_dummies-1024x611-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/digital_marketing_for_dummies.png)

### 5\. Keyword in Title

If you can't get your keyword in the URL for whatever reason, the next logical
place Googlebot looks to understand what the page is about is ... the title of
the page!

Seems obvious right? Well, it is.

Don't overthink this stuff.

Get your keyword(s) in the Title of your page.

For example, our article about [branding for
lawyers](https://devinschumacher.com/law-firm-branding/):

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/branding-for-
lawyers-screenshot.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/branding-for-lawyers-screenshot.png)

We like to lead with the title, and then add additional terms that are either
designed to make the page title more enticing to click on, or we use keyword
variations to give additional assurance to Googlebot that it is, in fact, in
the right place.

### 6\. Topical / Keyword Relevance of Referring Domains & Backlinks (Domain
Relevance Matching)

One of the major ways Google understand & establishes relevance/credibility of
a page (or website) is by looking at who is linking to that page.

Getting links to a page about Topic A from other **domains** that are all
about Topic A help solidify that you are in fact relevant for that Topic.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/referring-domains-
example-1024x444-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/referring-domains-example.png)

### 7\. Topical / Keyword Relevance of Entire Site (Page Relevance Matching)

Now that you understand that getting links from **domains** that are all about
Topic A to your page about Topic A is important, it is also important to get
links from **pages** that are all about Topic A.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/relevance-
matching-1024x539-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/relevance-matching.png)

Your goal should be to match the relevance from incoming link to link
destination.

### 6\. Keywords in Content

This should be obvious, but you want to get your keywords (and the variations)
spread throughout your content.

If they are in more important places (like headings, bolded content, etc.)
Google will see you are trying to place extra importance on them.

Don't go overboard, just be natural and cover all your bases.

At our agency, we plan all our content beforehand - finding keyword variations
(which we call semantic keywords) and also additional topics that can support
the purpose of the article (which we call supporting keywords).

It looks a bit like this:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/serp-co-seo-
content-strategy-1024x417-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/serp-co-seo-content-strategy.png)

### 7\. Content Quality & Length

Content length has been known to be a ranking factor in Google. That being
said, you can also rank with very thin content - we see it all the time.

But it does help to have more content.

 **Pro-tip** : See how long the top ranking articles are, and beat it. But
always keep on the top of mind that you don't want to write longer just for
the sake of writing longer. Answer the [search
intent](https://devinschumacher.com/search-intent/) of the query. Help the
user.

### 8\. Established Entity

  1. Use schema markup
  2. Brand establishment across relevant business directories & websites where a presence would be expected
  3. Claimed & optimized business properties (GMB, Facebook, Yelp, etc.)
  4. Quantity & quality of reviews

### 9\. Technical SEO Optimizations

  1. PageSpeed
  2. Mobile Friendliness
  3. No Indexing non-important content (tag archives, etc.)
  4. Reducing keyword cannibalization

### 10\. Time

An important factor that people miss.

 **Time refers to multiple things:**

  1. The length of time your domain has been around (domain age).
  2. The length of time the page that you are trying to rank has been live.
  3. The length of time since you acquired links to a page (link age).
  4. The length of time other websites have been competing for that term.
  5. etc.

## The Full List Google Ranking Factors

Google's ranking algorithm is gigantic. And over the years has only continue
to grow & become increasingly complex.

If you search for ""google ranking factors"" you will see articles with 200+
factors, 500+ factors, and even a software that claims to track over 880
factors:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/cora-seo-software-
ranking-factors-1024x579-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/cora-seo-software-ranking-factors.png)

So, as the algorithm grows & as we continue to uncover additional ranking
factors we will continue to add/update this list.

 **For convenience, we broke down the full list of Google ranking factors into
the following categories:**

  1. Domain Level Ranking Factors
  2. Page Level Ranking Factors
  3. Site Level Ranking Factors
  4. Backlink Factors
  5. User Signal Ranking Factors
  6. Brand Signal Ranking Factors
  7. Local Ranking Factors
  8. Negative Ranking Factors
  9. Other Ranking Factors

### Domain-Level

    
    
    8 domain level ranking factors

  *  **Domain Age** : Newer domains don't have as much trust - especially in the beginning. We have seen a big difference trying to rank keywords on a domain that has age vs. one that is newly registered.

  *  **Domain History** : Domain history is huge. Check the history of domains before you buy them. If a domain was previously penalized it can easily carry a penalty over to you (this has actually happened to us before).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-EdhaMDXho

  *  **Domain Registration Length** : According to [Google Patent Application #60507617](http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=%2220050071741%22.PGNR.&OS=DN/20050071741&RS=DN/20050071741) states the following:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-ranking-
favtor-domain-registration-
length-1024x57-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/google-ranking-favtor-domain-registration-length.png)

  *  **Keyword in Domain** : This is a huge benefit to ranking for that keyword. Covered above here.

  *  **Keyword in Subdomain** : Keywords in a subdomain is a ranking factor for the keyword. Pretty obvious.

  *  **TLD** : For years, SEOs have sworn that the more common TLDs (.com, .net, .org) carry more weight than the newer TLDs. Additionally, having a TLD from a certain country may help rank in that country but could limit you from ranking in other countries (have you seen a .co.uk domain ranking here in the USA lately? I haven't).

  *  **Whois Owner** : If an individual is flagged by Google as a spammer, and they register additional domains, that is a clear signal that more inappropriate behavior may follow. #seoCriminalHistory

  *  **Whois Privacy** : Protecting your identify with Whois privacy is not bad. But if you have alot of links coming to your website all from protected domains (an unnaturally high level) then it could be a sign you are up to something.

### Page-Level

    
    
    60 page level ranking factors

  *  **Affiliate Links** : Affiliate links are fine. Sites built entirely around affiliate commissions are subject to being suspect by Google. Why? Because the entire purpose is to make money - so it stands to reason that the site owner potentially doesn't have the users best interest in mind. 

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/affiliate-links-
as-a-ranking-favctor-1024x821-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/affiliate-links-as-a-ranking-favctor.png)

  * **AMP** : AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) load faster & are easier to access via mobile devices than non AMP pages. A clear signal that AMP would be preferred over non-AMP pages, considering Google's interest in mobile.

  *  **Broken Links** : Broken links on a page, or throughout a website, can be a sign that the webmaster has neglected, or abandoned, a website; and that it may no longer be trustworthy.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-09-13-at-9.22.20-pm-1024x159-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-13-at-9.22.20-PM.png)

  *  **Bullets and Numbered Lists** : Bullet & numbered (aka ordered & un-ordered lists) help with readability. If not a direct ranking factor, it is an indirect one because people will stay on your page longer (which definitely helps).

  *  **Content Length** : Our tests, and our colleagues tests, show that content length really can significantly help your page rank. And at the very least, it will allow more keywords to be correlated with your page - thereby giving you more keywords to rank for.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/02_content-total-
word-count_line-1024x705-1.png)(source: backlinko)

  *  **Content Recency** **/** **Update** **Frequency** : Google's Caffeine Update helps to provide more recent versions of indexed web pages, faster. [Here's how it works](https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors). Especially for time sensitive material (breaking news, etc.) it shows that the recency of your content helps to determine its validity. Even this article about Google ranking factors needs to be updated regularly, as Google's index continues to change.

  *  **Content Update Size** : Similar to content recency, the magnitude of the updates can be a signal to show how committed the webmaster/website owner is to providing quality, relevant & authoritative content.

  *  **Domain Authority (Rating)** : Domain Rating (Domain Authority) is a measure of how authoritative and trusted a website is in Google's eyes, based on the quantity and quality of the [backlinks](https://devinschumacher.com/backlinks/) it has. This is, in our opinion, the #1 Google ranking factor.

  *  **Topical Relevance / Hummingbird** : The [Google Hummingbird update ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Hummingbird)was engineered to helping Google understand the overall topic / theme of a webpage, rather than solely relying on reading keywords to determine its purpose. 

  * **Spelling / Grammar** : Quite obvious and easy to deal with. Use correct grammar and spelling on your page. Computers can tell if your document is written like a legitimate trusted piece of content, or if it is spun & rife with fundamental errors. You don't trust things with spelling errors, neither does Google.

  *  **HTML/Code Errors** : Just like we humans don't trust content with spelling & grammar mistakes, Google does not trust content with HTML mistakes (the computer equivalent of spelling/grammar). Follow [W3C Standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/).

  *  **Human Editors** : Human editing, similar to crowdsourcing (think Wikipedia), helps show Google that independent 3rd parties are confirming (or correcting) items on a website and that is a signal of trust. This happens alot in [Local SEO](https://devinschumacher.com//local/) on Google Maps.

  * [ **Internal Links](https://devinschumacher.com/internal-links/) (Quality)**: Internal links from a strong/authoritative page on a website have more SEO impact than internal links from a less authoritative page. This is sometimes called authority sculpting. _Key takeaway_ : find the pages on your website with alot of links (high UR) and link out from them to pages you want to add some power to.

  *  **Internal Links (Quantity)** : All else being equal, more links = more power & authority. So it is quite obvious to say that a page with more internal links pointing to it will carry more authority and a page with less.

  *  **Image[Alt Text**:](https://devinschumacher.com/alt-text/) Adding Alt Text to images helps web crawlers & screen readers understand more about the page. This is a signal of trust. It is also an opportunity to add relevance by using descriptions & keywords that tell web crawlers more about the page topic. Don't keyword stuff.

  *  **Image Description** : In WordPress (and other CMS solutions) there is an area to add a description to images. Like alt text, this is an opportunity to provide more context about what is on the page. Don't keyword stuff.

  * [ **Image Filenames** :](https://devinschumacher.com/image-filenames/) Image filenames are another place where you can add descriptive content about what an image is. Avoid generic or gibberish filenames for your images, but don't keyword stuff.

  *  **Image Uniqueness** : There's nothing that Google loves more than fresh new content. Using unique images in your content, and throughout your business profiles (like Google My Business) is always a good idea.

  * [ **Keyword Density** :](https://devinschumacher.com/keyword-density/) The amount of times a keyword appears in your text (in relation to the amount of total text is a signal to Google that it must be important. Otherwise, why would it show up so many times? This is similar to TF*IDF, but not the same. Do not over optimize. The formula for keyword density is simply: # of Keywords in content ÷ Total # of words in content

  *  **Keyword in Meta Description** : When you google something you will see keywords in the meta description being bolded, so we take that as a legitimate signal that Google is reading meta descriptions and placing importance. Another sign, is that Google sometimes re-writes meta descriptions (meaning that they want to exert control) thus showing their hand a little that meta description carries some weight. We prefer to use it for sales copy to get the user to click on the results more-so than as a place to put keywords for Googlebot.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/meta-description-
as-a-ranking-factor.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/meta-description-as-a-ranking-factor.png)

  *  **Keyword in Meta Content** : This used to be a place for [SEOs to stuff keywords](https://devinschumacher.com/seo-keywords/) in and snatch up rankings, but as of 2009 Google's official stance on the meta description area is that it no longer affects rankings. [Source](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2009/09/google-does-not-use-keywords-meta-tag.html):

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/is-meta-
description-a-ranking-factor-300x147-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/is-meta-description-a-ranking-factor.png)

  *  **Keyword in Title** : This is one of our Top 10 ranking factors.. Keyword in Title is a huge signal to Google. Utilize it.

  *  **Keyword in URL** : This is one of our Top 10 ranking factors. Keyword in URL is a huge signal to Google. Utilize it.

  *  **Keyword in <h1>:** This is one of our Top 10 ranking factors. The h1 tag is a very powerful section of your content. It is the ""header"" or ""title"" of your post, and carries with that alot of emphasis of importance. Putting a keyword(s) in your h1 tag is a direct sign to Google that you want to emphasize its importance.

  *  **Keyword Prominence (Content)** : Keyword prominence in content means that the main keyword you are trying to rank for appears within the first 100 words of the content. According to [this study](https://ahrefs.com/blog/on-page-seo/) by Ahrefs, this is a confirmed ranking factor.

  *  **Keyword Prominence (H1)** : Keyword prominence in the H1 means that it is the first word(s) of the h1 tag. 

  * **Keyword Prominence (Title)** : Keyword prominence in the Title means that it is the first word(s) of the h1 tag. This is a strategy you will probably notice that we use when publishing content. For example, our article about [digital marketing certifications](https://devinschumacher.com/digital-marketing-certifications/).

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/digital-marketing-
ideas-article-showing-article-title-
strategies.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/digital-marketing-ideas-article-showing-article-title-
strategies.png)

  *  **Keyword in Outbound Link Anchor Text** : For a long time SEOs have believed (and practiced) that outbound links to authoritative domains helped your SEO. This is the next step of that thought process, that the outbound links anchor text will add additional relevance.

  *  **Keyword in Heading tags (h2 to h6** ): In order of descending impact, heading tags h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 all show emphasis to Google. Putting keywords in H2 tags can definitely help your SERP visibility. In fact, we have snatched up alot of knowledge panels this way.

  *  **Keyword in <b> or <strong>** **HTML tags** : When you bold or ""strong"" words on the page you are telling the HTML to put emphasis on those words so users pay extra attention to them. It only stands to reason that web-crawlers will mimic that behavior and pay extra attention to them as well.

  *  **Keyword in <i> or <em> HTML tags**: Same reasoning as Keyword in <b> or <strong> HTML tags.

  *  **Latent Semantic Indexing Keywords (LSI)** : [LSI keywords](https://devinschumacher.com/lsi-keywords/) help search engines understand meaning like humans do. For example, if I write the word ""Target"" am I talking about the thing you shoot with a gun, or the business that sells paper towels on the cheap? LSIs (or the other words in the content) help us make a determination.

  *  **LSI Keywords in Title** : We like to use titles with semantic (similar/synonym) keywords. Using LSIs also seems like a good idea to build relevance & understanding.

  *  **Multimedia** : Google loves video (they own YouTube after all). They know that multimedia makes content more engaging, which makes people stay longer, which makes them happier. Include multimedia for a better user experience and [search engine](https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/) ranking boost.

  *  **Outbound Link Quality** : Quality is always something Google has cared about. And I will tell you with first hand experience, that if you link out to a toxic website it absolutely has the potential to negatively affect your search engine rankings (and can even get you a full blown penalty). If you don't believe me, review [The Hilltop Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilltop_algorithm).

  *  **Outbound Link Quantity** : There are 2 things to consider with outbound (do follow) links. #1: Too many links distracts from the pages purpose. #2 Too many DoFollow outbound links can bleed your page's link power, and cause a decrease in rankings. We have seen this one firsthand, but this point is highly contested in the SEO industry.

  *  **Outbound Link Theme** : I like to compare this to our description about LSI keywords in content. On your page about ""Target"" if you are linking out to gun sites, bow sites, hunting sites, etc. this helps Google understand you were in fact not talking about the place with great deals on paper towels.

  *  **Page Age** : We listed this under our Top 10 factors of ""Time"". Page age definitely helps. Yes, we have ranked things overnight - but it's easier to rank pages with age. And over time they seem to continue to improve their rankings (all other factors equal).

  *  **Page Category** : In WordPress you can create Category. These are archives (groups) of pages that all are about one primary topic. Having a page listed within a Category is a relevancy signal that Google can pick up on.

  *  **Page Tags** : In WordPress you can create Tag pages. These are archives (groups) of pages that all are about one primary topic. Having a page listed within a Tag is a relevancy signal that Google can pick up on.

  *  **Content goes in-depth on Topic** : A page that goes in depth about one topic has a better chance to rank for that topic than a page that just briefly mentions the topic, or is not comprehensively about it. We have seen this work very well in the affiliate space for terms breaking out separate articles ""best shampoo for red hair"" and ""best shampoo for thin hair"" vs. ""best shampoo for hair"". The specific, in-depth, comprehensive articles will usually perform better.

content/uploads/2019/09/content-in-depth-1418x976.png)(source: backlinko)

  *  **Page Load Speed** : Page Load speed drastically affects user satisfaction with a website, and so Google places a high importance on this ranking factor. So much so, that they even created a [PageSpeed Tool](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud) that will help you understand & optimize your page speed.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-

content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-14-at-4.46.41-PM.png)Looks like we
got some serious work to do!

  *  **Page Priority in[Sitemap](https://devinschumacher.com/sitemaps/)**: Where a page is prioritized in an XML Sitemap could potentially be a signal to Google about its importance.

  *  **Quantity of Additional Keywords a Page Ranks For** : If it's showing up well for other keywords then it must be trusted to some extent. 

  * **Ratio of Text to Code** : Google's official answer on this ranking factor is ""No"", they do not care about the ratio of Text to Code.

https://youtu.be/PvNnPd76xSU?t=1123

  *  **Reading Level** : Softwares can easily detect the reading level (sophistication) of a page. You want to make sure that the reading level of your page matches the intent of the page & intended reader.

  *  **Readability Score** : In addition to reading level, there is readability score. This effectively determines the amount of energy needed to read a post, and could very well be a ranking factor. For example, it would not be too difficult for Google to know that a medical journal should have a higher readability score than a post about ant farms.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/readability-as-a-
ranking-factor.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/readability-as-a-ranking-factor.png)

  *  **References and Source** : Citing your work with references/sources is a great way to show that the information you are quoting is credible. Good does this quite alot, so does Wikipedia. That should say something about its legitimacy.

  *  **rel=canonical** : We see alot of websites that have [duplicate content](https://devinschumacher.com/duplicate-content/) issues, or problems with keyword cannibalization. Use the canonical property to fix these issues. See instructions [here](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066?hl=en).

  *  **Supplementary Content** : This refers to items on a page that help to understand content. Things users can interact with. Like loan calculators, interactive items, etc. Google loves this stuff (their entire SERP is made out of it).

  *  **Syndicated Content** : You see this alot with press releases. Websites syndicate (aka take content from somewhere else and post it) content to provide interesting things for their readers. This content must be treated properly to duplicate content issues.

  *  **Tabbed Content** : John Mueller has stated that content behind tabs is something that Google is cautious about, but they use it alot. And we use it alot. And we have not seen any problems from it so far, in fact mostly just benefits.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/tabbed-content-
example.gif)An example of tabbed content

  *  **Table of Contents** : Using a properly coded table of contents is definitely something you want to do. It helps users with navigation, it gives Google more clicks that can be considered a user interaction signal, it creates a bunch of inner page (anchor) links, the list goes on. Use a TOC where necessary.

  *  **TF-*IDF** : TF*IDF is a math equation made into an acronym. It's a way for search engines to tell what is on your page based on the frequency of other related terms. If you can cater to the TF*IDF equation you can help your pages create relevance and improve your search rankings.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/the-hangover-
equation-gif.gif)

  *  **Unique Content** : Google wants content that is unique, and brings a fresh perspective (or research/information) to its index. It doesn't need multiple websites all saying the same things - that's just clutter.

  *  **URL Depth (Folder/Path level)** : Depth of a URL is something that I have always touted as a ranking factor. I have first hand experience that it matters. The closer your keyword is to the root folder path the easier it is to rank, typically.

  *  **URL Length** : An Ahrefs study has confirmed that shorter URLs rank more easily. Enough said.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ahrefs-url-length-
study-1024x667-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/ahrefs-url-length-study.png)

  *  **URL String** : URL strings come from breadcrumbs. Google likes breadcrumbs. Google displays URL strings in SERPs. I think that is indication enough that they could be considered a legitimate ranking factor.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/an_example_of_a_url_string_in_the_serp.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/an_example_of_a_url_string_in_the_serp.png)

  *  **Ads Appearing Above the Fold** : Google does not like this. They have stated it many times. Try to avoid if possible.

  *  **Use of Flash** : Google is discontinuing Flash in 2020. That should tell you enough about their sentiment.

### Site-Level

    
    
    14 site level ranking factors

  *  **Breadcrumbs** : Breadcrumbs help users (and web crawlers) easily navigate your website & understand here in the site hierarchy they currently are. [Google Search uses breadcrumb markup in the body of a web page to categorize the information from the page in search results. ](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/breadcrumb)

  * **Contact Us Page** : Having a contact us page helps show trust.

  *  **Google Analytics** : Having Google Analytics properly installed on your website is a trust signal.

  *  **Google Search Console** : Having Google Search Console properly integrated with your website is a trust signal.

  *  **Mobile Optimization** : Mobile optimized, mobile responsive, mobile friendly - these terms are used to state that your website is easy for consumers to use when accessed from a mobile device. Mobile devices come in 100s of different sizes, and having a website that is functional at all those screen sizes helps with rankings. Mobile test your website [here](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly).

  *  **Privacy Policy & Terms of Service Pages**: These pages show Google that your website has that extra layer of trustworthiness. 

  * **Reviews / Website Reputation** : How your website is seen by other non-related websites helps Google establish trust, the same way we humans do in real life.

  *  **Server Location** : Some SEOs believe that the geographical location of the server where your website is hosted affects your rankings.

  *  **Sitemap** : A sitemap helps Googlebot crawl, understand & index your website. Learn more about sitemaps [here](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/156184?hl=en).

  *  **SSL** : An SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate is a digital certification that authenticates the identity of a website & encrypts the information that is sent to the server. Aka - an SSL certificate helps information stay safely encrypted when people interact with your website.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ssl-as-a-ranking-
factor.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ssl-as-a-
ranking-factor.png)

  *  **Website Freshness** : How often (or not often) your website is updated, or how recently it has been updated, is believed to show Google that the site is being actively cared for and helps with the freshness. This has been denied by Google.

https://twitter.com/JohnMu/status/971098008644407297

  *  **Website Structure** : Your website's structure (architecture) shows how organized you are to Google, and can give Googlebot an easier time crawling, indexing & understanding your website.

  *  **Website Uptime** : 'Uptime' is exactly what it sounds like. The amount of time (expressed in a percentage of the whole) that your website is up, available & working for users to access it. Google doesn't like websites that are always going down or having problems because it presents a bad experience for searchers.

  *  **Website Usability** : If your website is problematic for users to use, then your rankings will be negatively affected. Googlebot can tell via user signals.

### Backlinks

    
    
    33 backlink ranking factors

  *  **Alt Tags (Image Links):** When you get a link from an image the ""alt text"" of the image is the anchor text. Utilize it.

  *  **Authority of Linking Domain** : A link from a more authoritative domain is more powerful (all else being equal) than a link from a domain with less authority. Try to get links from domains that have alot of links (a high DR in Ahrefs).

  *  **Authority of Linking Page** : A link from a more authoritative page is more powerful (all else being equal) than a link from a page with less authority. Try to get links from pages that have alot of links (a high UR in Ahrefs).

  *  **Co-Occurrence** : Co occurrence refers to the words that are in close proximity surrounding your link ([anchor text)](https://devinschumacher.com/anchor-text/). The sentence or two before and after. If you get relevant keywords in the proximity of your link it should help with the relevance.

  *  **Contextual Links** : Links found within the content of a page are generally thought to be more powerful than links in other places.

  *  **Keyword in Title** : Getting a relevant keyword in the title of the page that you are getting a link from is massively powerful. This is called relevance matching, and we cover it in our list of top 10 most powerful Google ranking factors, above.

  *  **Link Age** : Links take a while to kick in. So, the power of a link will increase as time goes on. We have observed this first hand. Some links we have placed have taken up to 9+ months to fully kick in.

  *  **Link Anchor Text** : The anchor text of a link is the clickable part. The words that are ""clickable"" are a very important ranking signal to Google. Use them wisely.

  *  **Link Diversity** : Diversity in your link profile is a huge factor for ranking. Diversity between link types (guest posts, citations, socials, etc.) and link rel (dofollow, nofollow, etc.) and link anchor text (the clickable words), etc. Blend in with your competitors, keep it natural, keep it diversified.

  *  **Link Type** : Different link types carry more weight. For example, a homepage link from an aged domain that is relevant to your target keyword (ie: a PBN link) will carry much more power than a link from a Twitter post.

  *  **Link Rel** : Link rel is an HTML thing. There are [alot of different rel types](https://www.deepcrawl.com/knowledge/technical-seo-library/different-types-of-links/), but the main ones to consider are dofollow vs. nofollow. Dofollow links are more impactful than nofollow links.

  *  **Link Title (tooltip) Attribution** : Link title (tooltip) is the text that shows up if you hover your cursor over a link. This could potentially be used as a Google ranking factor.

  *  **Linking Domain Age** : An older domain with trust could be factored into Google's algorithm as carrying more weight than a newer site. 

  * **Linking Domain Relevancy** : Always remember ""Relevance Matching"". The more relevance you can match the bigger SEO impact you will achieve.

  *  **Links from .edu or .gov Domains** : Links from EDU or GOV domains are thought to carry more weight, because they are much harder to get.

  *  **Links from “Expected” Websites** : Getting links from websites where Google would assume you would have links (for example: if you are a business it would be expected that you would get links from common business directories) should help your website establish trust.

  *  **Links from “Hub” Pages** : Another speculation on the Hilltop Algorithm, but one that makes sense to us. Getting a link from a page on a domain that is all about one type of resource, could ""batch"" you in with (or ""associate you"" to) other ""like minded"" or ""relevant"" websites and give you a relevance boost.

as-a-google-ranking-signal-1024x722-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/resources-pages-as-a-google-ranking-signal.png)

  *  **Links from 301** : a domain that is 301d carries all the weight of all its backlinks. If 301 a website to your website, it has alot of power - but be careful with this strategy it is easy to mess up. ProTip: make sure you match relevance everywhere.

  *  **Links From Ads** : Affiliate links and links from ads are supposed to be nofollow. But, we still believe that if the ads are relevant they can help sculpt your relevance profile, even if they don't directly pass link power.

  *  **Link from a Competitor** : If you can get a link from your competitor, that would be awesome. Enough said. Just do it.

  *  **Links from Different C-Class IPs** : Websites are served from hosts. Hosts are on IP addresses. If you get links from different blocks of IP addresses it can show Google that your popularity is diversified, or spread. Or at the very least, less likely to be manipulated.

  *  **Link Velocity** : Link velocity is a term that refers to how quickly you are acquiring links. A website with only a handful of links should not be acquiring links as quickly as a website with tens of thousands of links. Make sure your link velocity is natural. On the flip side, a negative link velocity can show that your website is losing momentum & interest.

  *  **Natural Link Profile** : One of the keys to victory in the SERPs is to _blend in_. Having a link profile that is unnatural is a very obvious way of not blending it, and something that Google notices quickly. Have a look at your competitors and see what _types_ of links they are getting and the _anchor text ratios_

  *  **Nofollow Links** : [No follow links](https://devinschumacher.com/no-follow-links/) do not carry as much power as dofollow links. They are still helpful though, in that they can help sculpt your relevance, and balance out your link profile so it looks/is natural.

  *  **Quality of Linking Content** : If you get a link from a page that has been deemed 'poor quality' it can pass a penalty to your website.

  *  **Quantity of Referring Domains** : More referring domains = more power (all else being equal).

  *  **Reciprocal Links** : Reciprocal links refer to websites that link to each other hoping to both power each other up. From our experience, this is okay in moderation, but if you over do it you run into [link scheme](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356?hl=en) problems.

  *  **Schema** : Schema is a way to give Google more information about what is on your website/webpage. From our own testing, this is a great way to get better ranking results.

  *  **Site-wide Links** : Site-wide links (like footer links) have been known to pass less power than contextual links.

  *  **Sponsored Links** : Sponsored links are links that were paid for. They now have their own link rel, rel=""sponsored"". They pass less power because Google knows you paid for them (aka they are not difficult to get and be used to manipulate your rankings). However, from our experience they still help your rankings.

  *  **User Generated Content (UGC) Links** : User generated content is easier to get than earned links. They now have their own link rel, rel=""UGC"". Therefore, it is easy to see how Google would value them less. However, they are still a good thing to do for link diversity, ""normal behavior"", ""blending in"", etc.

  *  **Web 2.0 Links** : Web 2.0s are a huge way to [build links](https://devinschumacher.com/link-building/) in SEO. Blogger, Tumblr, wordpress.com, etc. Google has recently implemented a link rel for UGC ""user-generated content"" and I image these blogs will begin to adopt it. Yes, it will affect the power these links pack.

  *  **Word Count of Linking Content** : More words = more effort. Google knows that spammer try and put in the least amount of effort possible, so this could be a ranking signal, however, from our personal experience, it does not matter.

### User Signals

    
    
    10 user signal ranking factors

  *  **Bounce Rate** : High bounce rate means users are coming to a page and leaving without doing anything. Aka, the page is not providing value. Google can easily see this, and would clearly want to supply their users with pages that seem to do a good job. Get your bounce rates under control.

  *  **Chrome Bookmarks** : Google tracks everything you do (that they have the ability to track) and bookmarking pages in Chrome is absolutely something they can do. Bookmark links used to be a huge way to build links. Many people see them as somewhat spammy now, but in moderation - I believe they can still be beneficial

  *  **Direct Traffic** : Google loves brands. And brands get direct traffic. I'll let you do the math on that one.

  *  **Dwell Time** : Dwell time is similar to Bounce Rate. It's how long someone stays on a page when coming in from a Google search. Obviously people who stay on your page longer will only benefit you. 

  * **Number of Comments on a post** : Comments show engagement. Google likes engagement. 

  * **Organic CTR for a Keyword** : If a lot of people are clicking on your result, it shows that the general population is intrigued by what you have in your page title. This is a user signal Google can easily pick up on and reward you for.

  *  **Pogo-sticking** : Pogo sticking is the behavior of a user when they get to a SERP, click on a result, and then hit the 'back button' to the SERP and click on another result in an attempt to find a proper answer to their search query. I'm sure you can relate to this one.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pogosticking-
image-1024x608-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/pogosticking-image.png)(source: backlinko)

  *  **RankBrain:** RankBrain is ""a [machine learning](https://jelvix.com/blog/ai-vs-machine-learning-vs-deep-learning)-based search engine algorithm .... that helps Google to process search results and provide more relevant search results for users"" ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RankBrain)). Although not really a ""single Google Ranking Factor"" it is worth mentioning here as it does affect your SERP position.

  *  **Social Media Likes/Interaction** : Real businesses get some kind of interaction on social. This is definitely a trust signal to Google. And don't fake it - Google can tell that too.

  *  **Repeat Traffic** : Repeat traffic is a fantastic way to show Google that your page is valuable. So valuable, in fact, that people come back again and again. Pro-tip: Use re-marketing to get people back to your page.

### Brand Signal Ranking Factors

    
    
    6 brand signal ranking factors

  *  **Authorship** : Authorship ties content to an entity (person). This creates trust. If there is a notable or known, author we humans trust that person more (usually). Google works the same way:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/authorship_as_a_google_ranking_signal.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/authorship_as_a_google_ranking_signal.png)

  *  **Branded Searches** : Google captures & catalogs all searches. If a brand is getting [search volume](https://devinschumacher.com/search-volume/) for its brand name, then Google sees this as a trust signal - because the brand is notable enough that people are actively searching for it by name. The more, the better.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/brand-
search.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/brand-
search.png)

  *  **Brand + KW Searches** : The next logical evolution after a brand name search is brand + keyword search. From our personal testing, we have seen this helps build the trust of a website/brand.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/brand-kw-
search.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/brand-kw-
search.png)

  *  **Brand Mentions:** Brand mentions are anytime a website writes your brand name somewhere in their article. Maybe it was mentioned on Twitter, or maybe within the content of a post. For example, we just brand mentioned ""Twitter"" right there in the last sentence. Did you pick up on that?

  *  **Branded Anchor Text** : Branded anchor text is normal. Big brands get alot of links pointing to them with their brand name as the clickable anchor text. For example, here is the anchor text profile for a large brand called Best Buy. Look how many links they have with branded anchors:

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/branded-anchor-
text-as-a-ranking-signal-1024x622-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/branded-anchor-text-as-a-ranking-signal.png)

  * [ **Social Foundations** : Having well established, completely filled out, and legitimately followed social media](https://devinschumacher.com/social-media-marketing-tools/) accounts is a natural part of any brand building. These are key signs to Google that your website should be trusted.

### Local Ranking Factors

    
    
    10 local ranking factors

  * Consistent Citations: Probably one of the most important local ranking factors, making sure that your business is listed properly & consistently across all online directories is a huge task, and very important. If Google sees that all the only directories have the same information it gives Google a lot of confidence that the information is still accurate and trustworthy. Check the consistency of your online presence [here](https://www.optimizelocation.com/partner/serpco/diagnostic.html).

  *  **Geo-Targeting** : Some SEOs think that if your server (host) is local to the geography you are targeting, that you will get ranking preference. The jury is still out on this one. We don't really think it matters.

  *  **Google My Business** : Claim & verify your Google My Business if you even want a _chance_ to show up in the maps.

  *  **Google My Business Categories** : Google something local related, look at the categories that show up, and you will see how much weight categories carry. Fill them outright, and fully.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gmb-categories-as-
a-ranking-factor-1024x424-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/GMB-categories-as-a-ranking-factor.png)

  *  **Links from Local sites** : There are a lot of websites that are geo-specific. For example, if you are a business in Los Angeles, it would be very beneficial to get a link from the West LA Chamber of Commerce. Get those types of links, and your local rankings will love you for it.

  *  **Local Searches** : For geo-related searches (ex: ""dentist near me"", ""dentist in los angeles"") Google will display a map pack. Make sure you have a verified Google My Business if you want the option of showing up there.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/law-firm-
marketing-company-shows-staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud-in-the-map-
pack.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/law-firm-
marketing-company-shows-staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud-in-the-map-
pack.png)

  *  **Physical Location** : Having a physical location is not a requirement, but it does show that your business is less likely to be a spammer than a real, trusted business.

  *  **Proximity to the Searcher** : Being close to the origin of the searcher is a huge benefit to showing up locally.

  *  **Reviews** : Both quality & quantity. Google loves reviews because they are done by independent 3rd parties - a great source of trust.

  *  **Review Responses** : The next best thing from reviews is responding to your reviews! This shows Google that the business is active and actually cares about its reputation, and how customers are being served.

### Negative Ranking Factors

    
    
    30 negative ranking factors

  *  **Duplicate Content** : Duplicate content is a huge no-no in the Google world. Check your website for [external duplicate content](http://copyscape.com) & [internal duplicate content](http://siteliner.com), and get the problem areas fixed ASAP.

  *  **Duplicate Meta Info** : Duplicate meta information falls under the duplicate content purview. Use [Screaming Frog](http://screamingfrog.com) to check your metas, and make sure they are unique.

  * [ **Affiliate Sites** : Google knows that website owners need to make money to run their business, and affiliate marketing](https://devinschumacher.com/affiliate-marketing-programs/) is a legitimate way to do it. However, sites that are created solely to refer traffic away and make an affiliate commission are not looked favorably by Google. Try to show that you have at least some sliver of non-monetary reason to be there. 

  * **Affiliate Link Hiding** : Hiding anything usually means you're up to no good. And if you just read the bullet point above, this one needs no explanation. Don't do this - or be very careful. Proceed at your own risk.

  *  **Autogenerated Content** : This just screams spam. Google hates spam. Enough said.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-09-15-at-12.58.59-pm.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2019-09-15-at-12.58.59-pm.png)

  *  **Cloaking** : Cloaking is when you show a user one thing, but show a search engine another thing. This is intentionally and obviously deceptive. If you get caught by Google you will be penalized/de-indexed.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHtnfOgp65Q

  *  **Doorway Pages** : Doorway pages are looked on as a kind of [black hat seo](https://devinschumacher.com/black-hat-seo/) trick, and Google does not like them. Full article [here](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2721311?hl=en).

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/doorway-pages-
definition.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/doorway-
pages-definition/)

  *  **PageRank Sculpting** : Page rank sculpting is defined as no-following all (or most) of your outbound links with the intention of keeping all your link power on the page, and not letting it flow out anywhere. Some SEOs think that Google picks up on this and will look unfavorably on it.

  *  **Fred Update** : Fred update targets low-quality pages. Keep them off your site, and you won't need to deal with Fred.

  *  **Full Page Popups** : Full page pop-ups, aka ""interstitial"" pop-ups, can be a bad user experience. Especially when they are hard to close, or there are multiple of them, or the user is on mobile, etc. Avoid annoying and unhelpful things and keep your user in mind, and your website rankings should benefit.

  *  **IP Flagged as Spam** : Obviously, if you have been flagged (or the host / IP you are on has been flagged) as spam, you will have a harder time earning trust. Avoid flagged IPs. Avoid bad neighborhoods.

  *  **Linking to Bad Neighborhoods** : Didn't we just say avoid bad neighborhoods? Yes, we did. Linking to (or getting links from) is a way of associating your website with others. Don't associate with stuff Google doesn't like. Only link out to websites you are 100% confident you can trust.

  *  **Meta Tag KW Stuffing** : Keyword stuffing anywhere is a no-no, and meta tags are just another place to not do that.

  *  **Panda Penalty** : A Panda Penalty is a content-related penalty. Usually having to do with thin/poor content or over-optimization of content. Don't over-optimize.

  *  **Pop-up Ads / Distracting Ads** : Are you old enough to remember how annoying the internet was just a few years ago? If you went to the wrong website you seriously had to shut down your computer to escape the onslaught of never-ending pop-ups. Users don't like it. Google doesn't like it. Don't do it.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/pop_up_ads.jpg)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/pop_up_ads.jpg)A day in the life of going on the
internet not too many years ago

  *  **Google Dance** : The [Google Dance](https://devinschumacher.com/google-dance/) can shake up your rankings temporarily. 

  * **Google Sandbox** : A heavily debated/contested topic in SEO, the Google Sandbox is basically what is responsible for link delays (ranking delays). When you get a link or links from a powerful site, Google does not ""fully release"" the full effect of the link power immediately. In fact, we have seen it take up to 9+ months for a link to fully kick in. You have the [Google Sandbox Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_effect) to thank for that.

  *  **Hacked Site** : If your site gets hacked, your rankings can be negatively impacted.

  *  **Link Profile, High % of High/Low-Quality Links** : This goes back to link diversity. You want to blend in. If you have an overly high % of links that are bad (or good even) your website will stand out, and your rankings can be affected.

  *  **Links From Press Releases** : Links from press releases can definitely hurt your site if you do them wrong. Getting a lot of dofollow links from a press release (especially if you use keyword anchor text) can seriously hurt your rankings for that keyword.

  *  **Links from the same Class IP Address** : If all your links (or a high majority of them) are from the same IP Class (A, B, C) it looks suspicious, and probably is. Google notices that, and you can get penalized. We have seen this happen first hand.

  *  **Links From Unrelated Sites** : Getting links from unrelated websites are said to not help you. In fact, we have tested this. A strong link from an unrelated website can definitely help your rankings. It's better to get a relevant one though.

  *  **Low-Quality Directory Links** : Getting links from directories that are irrelevant or low quality is something you probably want to stay away from. Check their traffic, DR, etc. and you will be fine.

  *  **Manual Actions** : Manual actions definitely affect your rankings. Check Google Search Console to see if you have any manual actions that require your attention.

  *  **Penguin Penalty** : If you get a Penguin Penalty your rankings will definitely be affected. This is a penalty that has to do with backlinks. If Google finds out (or suspects) that you have been manipulating your rankings, you will be penalized.

  *  **Reconsideration Request** : If your rankings have been affected, you got a manual penalty, and you made the changes you can submit a reconsideration request to try and repair your rankings. It may take a while, it may not work - but definitely do it because it can save you.

  *  **Selling Links** : If you are caught selling links Google will penalize or de-index your website. It happens all the time.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-09-15-at-2.22.06-pm.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/screen-shot-2019-09-15-at-2.22.06-pm.png)

  *  **Sudden Influx of Links (without other signals)** : As you probably know by now, anything unnatural that pops up on Google's radar is usually not a good thing. This applies to links as well. Sometimes websites naturally get a lot of links (breaking news, viral videos, etc.) but those are accompanied by a ton of other social signals. If you just get a bunch of links without traffic, shares, likes, etc. it looks very suspicious.

  *  **Toxic Links** : Some links are toxic. Make sure that the links your website has acquired are quality. And if they aren't good, disavow them.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/lrt-toxic-
links-1024x577-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/LRT-toxic-links.png)

  *  **Widget Links** : Some developers use plugins to build links to their site. When you install a theme or plugin, it will automatically put a link back to their site. Google does not like this (but it works extremely well to build rankings).

### Other Ranking Factors

  *  **Browsing History** : Browsing history can, and will, affect the SERP you see. Make sure that if you are checking your rankings, you are [browsing incognito](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).

  *  **DMCA Complaints** : If you violate internet copyright laws, and someone files a [DMCA complaint](https://www.dmca.com/) Google gets that information and sees that you are not playing by the rules, and can/will affect your rankings.

  *  **Domain Diversity** : Google's Bigfoot update was intended to make sure that when you do a search, you see a diverse selection of domains. Aka, they don't want to have the same domain (URL) ranking multiple times on the page. They want to give the searched choices.

  *  **Easter Eggs** : Easter eggs in Google refer to searches that trigger interesting things. If you are trying to rank for one of these, good luck - your rankings will be affected. One of my favorites is from the video game ""Star Fox"". In Google Chrome, go to Google and [search: do a barrel roll](https://www.google.com/search?q=do+a+barrel+roll&oq=do+a+barrel+roll&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3882j1j8&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). 

  * **Rich Snippet / Featured Snippet** : Featured snippets are a huge factor in ranking. First, if you are NOT the featured snippet, then the number of clicks you get from being on page 1 will be drastically lower than normal. Conversely, if you can get the rich snippet you will be snatching up a ton of clicks.

  *  **Image Results** : Image results are not necessarily a 'ranking factor' but they are something you will want. Images can drive results, and sometimes they do display in the regular SERP area.

  *  **Payday Loans Update** : The ""PayDay Loans"" update affects the rankings of spammy queries.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/payday-loans-
update-as-a-google-ranking-
factor-1024x419-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/payday-loans-update-as-a-google-ranking-factor.png)

  *  **Query Deserves Freshness (QDF)** : For certain search types, Google will boost the rankings of pages if they need (or ""deserve"") freshness. Think news, weather updates, etc.

  *  **Query Deserves Diversity (QDD)** : Google (potentially) recognizes search queries that have the potential for multiple different intents, like a search for the WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature  or World Wrestling Federation?) and attempt to modify the SERP results to include more options so the users intent is satisfied - no matter what they were searching for.

  *  **Safe Search** : Safe search is a Google feature that filters SERP results for the little ones. Parental controls basically. SERPs would have adult language and content removed.

  *  **Shopping Results** : If your search query has shopping intent attached to it, Googs will display shopping results (and ads) and that will affect the ranking of your page.

  *  **Single Site Results** : The opposite of QDD, single-site results will bring up the same site multiple times for a search. This primarily applies to brands. 

  * **Top Stories** : The Top Stories Box is another [SERP feature](https://devinschumacher.com/serp-features/), that if triggered will affect the rankings of your page.

  *  **Transactional Searches** : SERP results will be altered if the search has transactional intent/value.

  *  **YMYL Keywords** : YMYL = Your Money Your Life. This refers to searches that can significantly impact the health, wealth, or wellbeing of a person if they were to read the wrong (or right) information. Businesses in the YMYL niche are having all sorts of problems ranking for things as of right now (late 2019) as Google is making gigantic changes to their algorithm. Many businesses (even very large trusted websites are getting destroyed in the [SERPs)](https://devinschumacher.com/serp/).

that focusing on these top ranking factors will yield the biggest bang for
your buck in SEO.</p>
<h3>1. Referring Domains to your Domain (RDD)</h3>
<p>The quantity &amp; quality of referring domains (aka other websites) that link to
your domain (aka website) without rel=""nofollow"", rel=""ugc"", rel=""sponsored"".</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/RDD-definition.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/rdd-
definition-1024x205-1.png"" /></a></p>
<h3>2. Referring Domains to your Page (RDP)</h3>
<p>The quantity &amp; quality of referring domains (aka other websites) that link to
your <strong>specific page</strong> (aka URL) without rel=""nofollow"", rel=""ugc"",
rel=""sponsored"".</p>
<p>Getting links directly to a specific URL/page is an excellent way to boost the
<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/keyword-rank-tracking-tools/"">keyword rankings</a>
that page is indexing for.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/referring_domains_to_page-url.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/referring_domains_to_page-
url-1024x306-1.png"" /></a></p>
<h3>3. Keyword in Domain</h3>
<p>Getting the primary keyword you are targeting in the root domain will help.</p>
<p>For example, let's say you are trying to rank for ""diet pill reviews"".</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>EMD</strong> = Exact match domain (the root domain matches your keyword exactly (aka dietpillreviews.com)</li>
<li><strong>PMD</strong> = Partial match domain (the root domain matches your keyword partially (aka thedietpillguy.com)</li>
</ol>
<p>Having an ""EMD"" or ""PMD"" will help you rank for your desired keyword.</p>
<p>It can also be a problem though if it is not actually your brand name and you
are just using it in your domain to rank - you can easily over-optimize the
rest of the factors on accident.</p>
<h3>4. Keyword in URL</h3>
<p>If you can't get the keyword in your domain name (understandable) then having
it in your URL will be your next goal.</p>
<p>For example, if your business name is SERP Co but you want to rank for
""<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/digital-
marketing-for-dummies/"">digital marketing for dummies</a>"" it would be best to create an inner page on your
website that is all about that topic:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/digital_marketing_for_dummies.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/digital_marketing_for_dummies-1024x611-1.png"" /></a></p>
<h3>5. Keyword in Title</h3>
<p>If you can't get your keyword in the URL for whatever reason, the next logical
place Googlebot looks to understand what the page is about is ... the title of
the page!</p>
<p>Seems obvious right? Well, it is.</p>
<p>Don't overthink this stuff.</p>
<p>Get your keyword(s) in the Title of your page.</p>
<p>For example, our article about <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/law-firm-branding/"">branding for
lawyers</a>:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/branding-for-lawyers-screenshot.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/branding-for-
lawyers-screenshot.png"" /></a></p>
<p>We like to lead with the title, and then add additional terms that are either
designed to make the page title more enticing to click on, or we use keyword
variations to give additional assurance to Googlebot that it is, in fact, in
the right place.</p>
<h3>6. Topical / Keyword Relevance of Referring Domains &amp; Backlinks (Domain</h3>
<p>Relevance Matching)</p>
<p>One of the major ways Google understand &amp; establishes relevance/credibility of
a page (or website) is by looking at who is linking to that page.</p>
<p>Getting links to a page about Topic A from other <strong>domains</strong> that are all
about Topic A help solidify that you are in fact relevant for that Topic.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/referring-domains-example.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/referring-domains-
example-1024x444-1.png"" /></a></p>
<h3>7. Topical / Keyword Relevance of Entire Site (Page Relevance Matching)</h3>
<p>Now that you understand that getting links from <strong>domains</strong> that are all about
Topic A to your page about Topic A is important, it is also important to get
links from <strong>pages</strong> that are all about Topic A.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/relevance-matching.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/relevance-
matching-1024x539-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>Your goal should be to match the relevance from incoming link to link
destination.</p>
<h3>6. Keywords in Content</h3>
<p>This should be obvious, but you want to get your keywords (and the variations)
spread throughout your content.</p>
<p>If they are in more important places (like headings, bolded content, etc.)
Google will see you are trying to place extra importance on them.</p>
<p>Don't go overboard, just be natural and cover all your bases.</p>
<p>At our agency, we plan all our content beforehand - finding keyword variations
(which we call semantic keywords) and also additional topics that can support
the purpose of the article (which we call supporting keywords).</p>
<p>It looks a bit like this:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/serp-co-seo-content-strategy.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/serp-co-seo-
content-strategy-1024x417-1.png"" /></a></p>
<h3>7. Content Quality &amp; Length</h3>
<p>Content length has been known to be a ranking factor in Google. That being
said, you can also rank with very thin content - we see it all the time.</p>
<p>But it does help to have more content.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-tip</strong> : See how long the top ranking articles are, and beat it. But
always keep on the top of mind that you don't want to write longer just for
the sake of writing longer. Answer the <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/search-intent/"">search
intent</a> of the query. Help the
user.</p>
<h3>8. Established Entity</h3>
<ol>
<li>Use schema markup</li>
<li>Brand establishment across relevant business directories &amp; websites where a presence would be expected</li>
<li>Claimed &amp; optimized business properties (GMB, Facebook, Yelp, etc.)</li>
<li>Quantity &amp; quality of reviews</li>
</ol>
<h3>9. Technical SEO Optimizations</h3>
<ol>
<li>PageSpeed</li>
<li>Mobile Friendliness</li>
<li>No Indexing non-important content (tag archives, etc.)</li>
<li>Reducing keyword cannibalization</li>
</ol>
<h3>10. Time</h3>
<p>An important factor that people miss.</p>
<p><strong>Time refers to multiple things:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The length of time your domain has been around (domain age).</li>
<li>The length of time the page that you are trying to rank has been live.</li>
<li>The length of time since you acquired links to a page (link age).</li>
<li>The length of time other websites have been competing for that term.</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Full List Google Ranking Factors</h2>
<p>Google's ranking algorithm is gigantic. And over the years has only continue
to grow &amp; become increasingly complex.</p>
<p>If you search for ""google ranking factors"" you will see articles with 200+
factors, 500+ factors, and even a software that claims to track over 880
factors:</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/cora-seo-software-ranking-factors.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/cora-seo-software-
ranking-factors-1024x579-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p>So, as the algorithm grows &amp; as we continue to uncover additional ranking
factors we will continue to add/update this list.</p>
<p><strong>For convenience, we broke down the full list of Google ranking factors into
the following categories:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Domain Level Ranking Factors</li>
<li>Page Level Ranking Factors</li>
<li>Site Level Ranking Factors</li>
<li>Backlink Factors</li>
<li>User Signal Ranking Factors</li>
<li>Brand Signal Ranking Factors</li>
<li>Local Ranking Factors</li>
<li>Negative Ranking Factors</li>
<li>Other Ranking Factors</li>
</ol>
<h3>Domain-Level</h3>
<pre><code>8 domain level ranking factors
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Domain Age</strong> : Newer domains don't have as much trust - especially in the beginning. We have seen a big difference trying to rank keywords on a domain that has age vs. one that is newly registered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Domain History</strong> : Domain history is huge. Check the history of domains before you buy them. If a domain was previously penalized it can easily carry a penalty over to you (this has actually happened to us before).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-EdhaMDXho</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain Registration Length</strong> : According to <a href=""http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=%2220050071741%22.PGNR.&amp;OS=DN/20050071741&amp;RS=DN/20050071741"">Google Patent Application #60507617</a> states the following:</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/google-ranking-favtor-domain-registration-length.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-ranking-
favtor-domain-registration-
length-1024x57-1.png"" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Keyword in Domain</strong> : This is a huge benefit to ranking for that keyword. Covered above here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keyword in Subdomain</strong> : Keywords in a subdomain is a ranking factor for the keyword. Pretty obvious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TLD</strong> : For years, SEOs have sworn that the more common TLDs (.com, .net, .org) carry more weight than the newer TLDs. Additionally, having a TLD from a certain country may help rank in that country but could limit you from ranking in other countries (have you seen a .co.uk domain ranking here in the USA lately? I haven't).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Whois Owner</strong> : If an individual is flagged by Google as a spammer, and they register additional domains, that is a clear signal that more inappropriate behavior may follow. #seoCriminalHistory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Whois Privacy</strong> : Protecting your identify with Whois privacy is not bad. But if you have alot of links coming to your website all from protected domains (an unnaturally high level) then it could be a sign you are up to something.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Page-Level</h3>
<pre><code>60 page level ranking factors
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Affiliate Links</strong> : Affiliate links are fine. Sites built entirely around affiliate commissions are subject to being suspect by Google. Why? Because the entire purpose is to make money - so it stands to reason that the site owner potentially doesn't have the users best interest in mind. </li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/affiliate-links-as-a-ranking-favctor.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/affiliate-links-
as-a-ranking-favctor-1024x821-1.png"" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>AMP</strong> : AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) load faster &amp; are easier to access via mobile devices than non AMP pages. A clear signal that AMP would be preferred over non-AMP pages, considering Google's interest in mobile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Broken Links</strong> : Broken links on a page, or throughout a website, can be a sign that the webmaster has neglected, or abandoned, a website; and that it may no longer be trustworthy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-13-at-9.22.20-PM.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2019-09-13-at-9.22.20-pm-1024x159-1.png"" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Bullets and Numbered Lists</strong> : Bullet &amp; numbered (aka ordered &amp; un-ordered lists) help with readability. If not a direct ranking factor, it is an indirect one because people will stay on your page longer (which definitely helps).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Content Length</strong> : Our tests, and our colleagues tests, show that content length really can significantly help your page rank. And at the very least, it will allow more keywords to be correlated with your page - thereby giving you more keywords to rank for.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/02_content-total-
word-count_line-1024x705-1.png"" />(source: backlinko)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Content Recency</strong> <strong>/</strong> <strong>Update</strong> <strong>Frequency</strong> : Google's Caffeine Update helps to provide more recent versions of indexed web pages, faster. <a href=""https://backlinko.com/google-ranking-factors"">Here's how it works</a>. Especially for time sensitive material (breaking news, etc.) it shows that the recency of your content helps to determine its validity. Even this article about Google ranking factors needs to be updated regularly, as Google's index continues to change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Content Update Size</strong> : Similar to content recency, the magnitude of the updates can be a signal to show how committed the webmaster/website owner is to providing quality, relevant &amp; authoritative content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Domain Authority (Rating)</strong> : Domain Rating (Domain Authority) is a measure of how authoritative and trusted a website is in Google's eyes, based on the quantity and quality of the <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/backlinks/"">backlinks</a> it has. This is, in our opinion, the #1 Google ranking factor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Topical Relevance / Hummingbird</strong> : The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Hummingbird"">Google Hummingbird update </a>was engineered to helping Google understand the overall topic / theme of a webpage, rather than solely relying on reading keywords to determine its purpose. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spelling / Grammar</strong> : Quite obvious and easy to deal with. Use correct grammar and spelling on your page. Computers can tell if your document is written like a legitimate trusted piece of content, or if it is spun &amp; rife with fundamental errors. You don't trust things with spelling errors, neither does Google.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>HTML/Code Errors</strong> : Just like we humans don't trust content with spelling &amp; grammar mistakes, Google does not trust content with HTML mistakes (the computer equivalent of spelling/grammar). Follow <a href=""https://www.w3.org/standards/"">W3C Standards</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Human Editors</strong> : Human editing, similar to crowdsourcing (think Wikipedia), helps show Google that independent 3rd parties are confirming (or correcting) items on a website and that is a signal of trust. This happens alot in <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com//local/"">Local SEO</a> on Google Maps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/internal-links/""> **Internal Links</a> (Quality)**: Internal links from a strong/authoritative page on a website have more SEO impact than internal links from a less authoritative page. This is sometimes called authority sculpting. <em>Key takeaway</em> : find the pages on your website with alot of links (high UR) and link out from them to pages you want to add some power to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Internal Links (Quantity)</strong> : All else being equal, more links = more power &amp; authority. So it is quite obvious to say that a page with more internal links pointing to it will carry more authority and a page with less.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Image<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/alt-text/"">Alt Text**:</a> Adding Alt Text to images helps web crawlers &amp; screen readers understand more about the page. This is a signal of trust. It is also an opportunity to add relevance by using descriptions &amp; keywords that tell web crawlers more about the page topic. Don't keyword stuff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Image Description</strong> : In WordPress (and other CMS solutions) there is an area to add a description to images. Like alt text, this is an opportunity to provide more context about what is on the page. Don't keyword stuff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/image-filenames/""> <strong>Image Filenames</strong> :</a> Image filenames are another place where you can add descriptive content about what an image is. Avoid generic or gibberish filenames for your images, but don't keyword stuff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Image Uniqueness</strong> : There's nothing that Google loves more than fresh new content. Using unique images in your content, and throughout your business profiles (like Google My Business) is always a good idea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/keyword-density/""> <strong>Keyword Density</strong> :</a> The amount of times a keyword appears in your text (in relation to the amount of total text is a signal to Google that it must be important. Otherwise, why would it show up so many times? This is similar to TF*IDF, but not the same. Do not over optimize. The formula for keyword density is simply: # of Keywords in content ÷ Total # of words in content</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keyword in Meta Description</strong> : When you google something you will see keywords in the meta description being bolded, so we take that as a legitimate signal that Google is reading meta descriptions and placing importance. Another sign, is that Google sometimes re-writes meta descriptions (meaning that they want to exert control) thus showing their hand a little that meta description carries some weight. We prefer to use it for sales copy to get the user to click on the results more-so than as a place to put keywords for Googlebot.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Keyword in Meta Content</strong> : This used to be a place for <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/seo-keywords/"">SEOs to stuff keywords</a> in and snatch up rankings, but as of 2009 Google's official stance on the meta description area is that it no longer affects rankings. <a href=""https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2009/09/google-does-not-use-keywords-meta-tag.html"">Source</a>:</li>
</ul>

description-a-ranking-factor-300x147-1.png"" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Keyword in Title</strong> : This is one of our Top 10 ranking factors.. Keyword in Title is a huge signal to Google. Utilize it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keyword in URL</strong> : This is one of our Top 10 ranking factors. Keyword in URL is a huge signal to Google. Utilize it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keyword in <h1>:</strong> This is one of our Top 10 ranking factors. The h1 tag is a very powerful section of your content. It is the ""header"" or ""title"" of your post, and carries with that alot of emphasis of importance. Putting a keyword(s) in your h1 tag is a direct sign to Google that you want to emphasize its importance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keyword Prominence (Content)</strong> : Keyword prominence in content means that the main keyword you are trying to rank for appears within the first 100 words of the content. According to <a href=""https://ahrefs.com/blog/on-page-seo/"">this study</a> by Ahrefs, this is a confirmed ranking factor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keyword Prominence (H1)</strong> : Keyword prominence in the H1 means that it is the first word(s) of the h1 tag. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keyword Prominence (Title)</strong> : Keyword prominence in the Title means that it is the first word(s) of the h1 tag. This is a strategy you will probably notice that we use when publishing content. For example, our article about <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/digital-marketing-certifications/"">digital marketing certifications</a>.</p>
</li>

strategies.png"" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Keyword in Outbound Link Anchor Text</strong> : For a long time SEOs have believed (and practiced) that outbound links to authoritative domains helped your SEO. This is the next step of that thought process, that the outbound links anchor text will add additional relevance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keyword in Heading tags (h2 to h6</strong> ): In order of descending impact, heading tags h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 all show emphasis to Google. Putting keywords in H2 tags can definitely help your SERP visibility. In fact, we have snatched up alot of knowledge panels this way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keyword in <b> or <strong></strong> <strong>HTML tags</strong> : When you bold or ""strong"" words on the page you are telling the HTML to put emphasis on those words so users pay extra attention to them. It only stands to reason that web-crawlers will mimic that behavior and pay extra attention to them as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keyword in <i> or <em> HTML tags</strong>: Same reasoning as Keyword in <b> or <strong> HTML tags.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Latent Semantic Indexing Keywords (LSI)</strong> : <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/lsi-keywords/"">LSI keywords</a> help search engines understand meaning like humans do. For example, if I write the word ""Target"" am I talking about the thing you shoot with a gun, or the business that sells paper towels on the cheap? LSIs (or the other words in the content) help us make a determination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>LSI Keywords in Title</strong> : We like to use titles with semantic (similar/synonym) keywords. Using LSIs also seems like a good idea to build relevance &amp; understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multimedia</strong> : Google loves video (they own YouTube after all). They know that multimedia makes content more engaging, which makes people stay longer, which makes them happier. Include multimedia for a better user experience and <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/"">search engine</a> ranking boost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Outbound Link Quality</strong> : Quality is always something Google has cared about. And I will tell you with first hand experience, that if you link out to a toxic website it absolutely has the potential to negatively affect your search engine rankings (and can even get you a full blown penalty). If you don't believe me, review <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilltop_algorithm"">The Hilltop Algorithm</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Outbound Link Quantity</strong> : There are 2 things to consider with outbound (do follow) links. #1: Too many links distracts from the pages purpose. #2 Too many DoFollow outbound links can bleed your page's link power, and cause a decrease in rankings. We have seen this one firsthand, but this point is highly contested in the SEO industry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Outbound Link Theme</strong> : I like to compare this to our description about LSI keywords in content. On your page about ""Target"" if you are linking out to gun sites, bow sites, hunting sites, etc. this helps Google understand you were in fact not talking about the place with great deals on paper towels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Page Age</strong> : We listed this under our Top 10 factors of ""Time"". Page age definitely helps. Yes, we have ranked things overnight - but it's easier to rank pages with age. And over time they seem to continue to improve their rankings (all other factors equal).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Page Category</strong> : In WordPress you can create Category. These are archives (groups) of pages that all are about one primary topic. Having a page listed within a Category is a relevancy signal that Google can pick up on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Page Tags</strong> : In WordPress you can create Tag pages. These are archives (groups) of pages that all are about one primary topic. Having a page listed within a Tag is a relevancy signal that Google can pick up on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Content goes in-depth on Topic</strong> : A page that goes in depth about one topic has a better chance to rank for that topic than a page that just briefly mentions the topic, or is not comprehensively about it. We have seen this work very well in the affiliate space for terms breaking out separate articles ""best shampoo for red hair"" and ""best shampoo for thin hair"" vs. ""best shampoo for hair"". The specific, in-depth, comprehensive articles will usually perform better.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Page Load Speed</strong> : Page Load speed drastically affects user satisfaction with a website, and so Google places a high importance on this ranking factor. So much so, that they even created a <a href=""https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud"">PageSpeed Tool</a> that will help you understand &amp; optimize your page speed.</li>

got some serious work to do!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Page Priority in<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/sitemaps/"">Sitemap</a></strong>: Where a page is prioritized in an XML Sitemap could potentially be a signal to Google about its importance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quantity of Additional Keywords a Page Ranks For</strong> : If it's showing up well for other keywords then it must be trusted to some extent. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ratio of Text to Code</strong> : Google's official answer on this ranking factor is ""No"", they do not care about the ratio of Text to Code.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reading Level</strong> : Softwares can easily detect the reading level (sophistication) of a page. You want to make sure that the reading level of your page matches the intent of the page &amp; intended reader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Readability Score</strong> : In addition to reading level, there is readability score. This effectively determines the amount of energy needed to read a post, and could very well be a ranking factor. For example, it would not be too difficult for Google to know that a medical journal should have a higher readability score than a post about ant farms.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>References and Source</strong> : Citing your work with references/sources is a great way to show that the information you are quoting is credible. Good does this quite alot, so does Wikipedia. That should say something about its legitimacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>rel=canonical</strong> : We see alot of websites that have <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/duplicate-content/"">duplicate content</a> issues, or problems with keyword cannibalization. Use the canonical property to fix these issues. See instructions <a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066?hl=en"">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Supplementary Content</strong> : This refers to items on a page that help to understand content. Things users can interact with. Like loan calculators, interactive items, etc. Google loves this stuff (their entire SERP is made out of it).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Syndicated Content</strong> : You see this alot with press releases. Websites syndicate (aka take content from somewhere else and post it) content to provide interesting things for their readers. This content must be treated properly to duplicate content issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tabbed Content</strong> : John Mueller has stated that content behind tabs is something that Google is cautious about, but they use it alot. And we use it alot. And we have not seen any problems from it so far, in fact mostly just benefits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/tabbed-content-
example.gif"" />An example of tabbed content</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Table of Contents</strong> : Using a properly coded table of contents is definitely something you want to do. It helps users with navigation, it gives Google more clicks that can be considered a user interaction signal, it creates a bunch of inner page (anchor) links, the list goes on. Use a TOC where necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TF-*IDF</strong> : TF<em>IDF is a math equation made into an acronym. It's a way for search engines to tell what is on your page based on the frequency of other related terms. If you can cater to the TF</em>IDF equation you can help your pages create relevance and improve your search rankings.</p>
</li>
</ul>

equation-gif.gif"" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Unique Content</strong> : Google wants content that is unique, and brings a fresh perspective (or research/information) to its index. It doesn't need multiple websites all saying the same things - that's just clutter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>URL Depth (Folder/Path level)</strong> : Depth of a URL is something that I have always touted as a ranking factor. I have first hand experience that it matters. The closer your keyword is to the root folder path the easier it is to rank, typically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>URL Length</strong> : An Ahrefs study has confirmed that shorter URLs rank more easily. Enough said.</p>
</li>
</ul>

study-1024x667-1.png"" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>URL String</strong> : URL strings come from breadcrumbs. Google likes breadcrumbs. Google displays URL strings in SERPs. I think that is indication enough that they could be considered a legitimate ranking factor.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Ads Appearing Above the Fold</strong> : Google does not like this. They have stated it many times. Try to avoid if possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use of Flash</strong> : Google is discontinuing Flash in 2020. That should tell you enough about their sentiment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Site-Level</h3>
<pre><code>14 site level ranking factors
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Breadcrumbs</strong> : Breadcrumbs help users (and web crawlers) easily navigate your website &amp; understand here in the site hierarchy they currently are. <a href=""https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/breadcrumb"">Google Search uses breadcrumb markup in the body of a web page to categorize the information from the page in search results. </a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contact Us Page</strong> : Having a contact us page helps show trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Google Analytics</strong> : Having Google Analytics properly installed on your website is a trust signal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Google Search Console</strong> : Having Google Search Console properly integrated with your website is a trust signal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mobile Optimization</strong> : Mobile optimized, mobile responsive, mobile friendly - these terms are used to state that your website is easy for consumers to use when accessed from a mobile device. Mobile devices come in 100s of different sizes, and having a website that is functional at all those screen sizes helps with rankings. Mobile test your website <a href=""https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly"">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Privacy Policy &amp; Terms of Service Pages</strong>: These pages show Google that your website has that extra layer of trustworthiness. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reviews / Website Reputation</strong> : How your website is seen by other non-related websites helps Google establish trust, the same way we humans do in real life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Server Location</strong> : Some SEOs believe that the geographical location of the server where your website is hosted affects your rankings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sitemap</strong> : A sitemap helps Googlebot crawl, understand &amp; index your website. Learn more about sitemaps <a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/156184?hl=en"">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SSL</strong> : An SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate is a digital certification that authenticates the identity of a website &amp; encrypts the information that is sent to the server. Aka - an SSL certificate helps information stay safely encrypted when people interact with your website.</p>
</li>
</ul>

factor.png"" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Website Freshness</strong> : How often (or not often) your website is updated, or how recently it has been updated, is believed to show Google that the site is being actively cared for and helps with the freshness. This has been denied by Google.</li>
</ul>
<p>https://twitter.com/JohnMu/status/971098008644407297</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Website Structure</strong> : Your website's structure (architecture) shows how organized you are to Google, and can give Googlebot an easier time crawling, indexing &amp; understanding your website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Website Uptime</strong> : 'Uptime' is exactly what it sounds like. The amount of time (expressed in a percentage of the whole) that your website is up, available &amp; working for users to access it. Google doesn't like websites that are always going down or having problems because it presents a bad experience for searchers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Website Usability</strong> : If your website is problematic for users to use, then your rankings will be negatively affected. Googlebot can tell via user signals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Backlinks</h3>
<pre><code>33 backlink ranking factors
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alt Tags (Image Links):</strong> When you get a link from an image the ""alt text"" of the image is the anchor text. Utilize it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Authority of Linking Domain</strong> : A link from a more authoritative domain is more powerful (all else being equal) than a link from a domain with less authority. Try to get links from domains that have alot of links (a high DR in Ahrefs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Authority of Linking Page</strong> : A link from a more authoritative page is more powerful (all else being equal) than a link from a page with less authority. Try to get links from pages that have alot of links (a high UR in Ahrefs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Co-Occurrence</strong> : Co occurrence refers to the words that are in close proximity surrounding your link (<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/anchor-text/"">anchor text)</a>. The sentence or two before and after. If you get relevant keywords in the proximity of your link it should help with the relevance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contextual Links</strong> : Links found within the content of a page are generally thought to be more powerful than links in other places.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keyword in Title</strong> : Getting a relevant keyword in the title of the page that you are getting a link from is massively powerful. This is called relevance matching, and we cover it in our list of top 10 most powerful Google ranking factors, above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Link Age</strong> : Links take a while to kick in. So, the power of a link will increase as time goes on. We have observed this first hand. Some links we have placed have taken up to 9+ months to fully kick in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Link Anchor Text</strong> : The anchor text of a link is the clickable part. The words that are ""clickable"" are a very important ranking signal to Google. Use them wisely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Link Diversity</strong> : Diversity in your link profile is a huge factor for ranking. Diversity between link types (guest posts, citations, socials, etc.) and link rel (dofollow, nofollow, etc.) and link anchor text (the clickable words), etc. Blend in with your competitors, keep it natural, keep it diversified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Link Type</strong> : Different link types carry more weight. For example, a homepage link from an aged domain that is relevant to your target keyword (ie: a PBN link) will carry much more power than a link from a Twitter post.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Link Rel</strong> : Link rel is an HTML thing. There are <a href=""https://www.deepcrawl.com/knowledge/technical-seo-library/different-types-of-links/"">alot of different rel types</a>, but the main ones to consider are dofollow vs. nofollow. Dofollow links are more impactful than nofollow links.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Link Title (tooltip) Attribution</strong> : Link title (tooltip) is the text that shows up if you hover your cursor over a link. This could potentially be used as a Google ranking factor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Linking Domain Age</strong> : An older domain with trust could be factored into Google's algorithm as carrying more weight than a newer site. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Linking Domain Relevancy</strong> : Always remember ""Relevance Matching"". The more relevance you can match the bigger SEO impact you will achieve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Links from .edu or .gov Domains</strong> : Links from EDU or GOV domains are thought to carry more weight, because they are much harder to get.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Links from “Expected” Websites</strong> : Getting links from websites where Google would assume you would have links (for example: if you are a business it would be expected that you would get links from common business directories) should help your website establish trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Links from “Hub” Pages</strong> : Another speculation on the Hilltop Algorithm, but one that makes sense to us. Getting a link from a page on a domain that is all about one type of resource, could ""batch"" you in with (or ""associate you"" to) other ""like minded"" or ""relevant"" websites and give you a relevance boost.</p>
</li>
</ul>

as-a-google-ranking-signal-1024x722-1.png"" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Links from 301</strong> : a domain that is 301d carries all the weight of all its backlinks. If 301 a website to your website, it has alot of power - but be careful with this strategy it is easy to mess up. ProTip: make sure you match relevance everywhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Links From Ads</strong> : Affiliate links and links from ads are supposed to be nofollow. But, we still believe that if the ads are relevant they can help sculpt your relevance profile, even if they don't directly pass link power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Link from a Competitor</strong> : If you can get a link from your competitor, that would be awesome. Enough said. Just do it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Links from Different C-Class IPs</strong> : Websites are served from hosts. Hosts are on IP addresses. If you get links from different blocks of IP addresses it can show Google that your popularity is diversified, or spread. Or at the very least, less likely to be manipulated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Link Velocity</strong> : Link velocity is a term that refers to how quickly you are acquiring links. A website with only a handful of links should not be acquiring links as quickly as a website with tens of thousands of links. Make sure your link velocity is natural. On the flip side, a negative link velocity can show that your website is losing momentum &amp; interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Natural Link Profile</strong> : One of the keys to victory in the SERPs is to <em>blend in</em>. Having a link profile that is unnatural is a very obvious way of not blending it, and something that Google notices quickly. Have a look at your competitors and see what <em>types</em> of links they are getting and the <em>anchor text ratios</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nofollow Links</strong> : <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/no-follow-links/"">No follow links</a> do not carry as much power as dofollow links. They are still helpful though, in that they can help sculpt your relevance, and balance out your link profile so it looks/is natural.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quality of Linking Content</strong> : If you get a link from a page that has been deemed 'poor quality' it can pass a penalty to your website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quantity of Referring Domains</strong> : More referring domains = more power (all else being equal).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reciprocal Links</strong> : Reciprocal links refer to websites that link to each other hoping to both power each other up. From our experience, this is okay in moderation, but if you over do it you run into <a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66356?hl=en"">link scheme</a> problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Schema</strong> : Schema is a way to give Google more information about what is on your website/webpage. From our own testing, this is a great way to get better ranking results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Site-wide Links</strong> : Site-wide links (like footer links) have been known to pass less power than contextual links.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sponsored Links</strong> : Sponsored links are links that were paid for. They now have their own link rel, rel=""sponsored"". They pass less power because Google knows you paid for them (aka they are not difficult to get and be used to manipulate your rankings). However, from our experience they still help your rankings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User Generated Content (UGC) Links</strong> : User generated content is easier to get than earned links. They now have their own link rel, rel=""UGC"". Therefore, it is easy to see how Google would value them less. However, they are still a good thing to do for link diversity, ""normal behavior"", ""blending in"", etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Web 2.0 Links</strong> : Web 2.0s are a huge way to <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/link-building/"">build links</a> in SEO. Blogger, Tumblr, wordpress.com, etc. Google has recently implemented a link rel for UGC ""user-generated content"" and I image these blogs will begin to adopt it. Yes, it will affect the power these links pack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Word Count of Linking Content</strong> : More words = more effort. Google knows that spammer try and put in the least amount of effort possible, so this could be a ranking signal, however, from our personal experience, it does not matter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>User Signals</h3>
<pre><code>10 user signal ranking factors
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Bounce Rate</strong> : High bounce rate means users are coming to a page and leaving without doing anything. Aka, the page is not providing value. Google can easily see this, and would clearly want to supply their users with pages that seem to do a good job. Get your bounce rates under control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Chrome Bookmarks</strong> : Google tracks everything you do (that they have the ability to track) and bookmarking pages in Chrome is absolutely something they can do. Bookmark links used to be a huge way to build links. Many people see them as somewhat spammy now, but in moderation - I believe they can still be beneficial</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct Traffic</strong> : Google loves brands. And brands get direct traffic. I'll let you do the math on that one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dwell Time</strong> : Dwell time is similar to Bounce Rate. It's how long someone stays on a page when coming in from a Google search. Obviously people who stay on your page longer will only benefit you. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Number of Comments on a post</strong> : Comments show engagement. Google likes engagement. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Organic CTR for a Keyword</strong> : If a lot of people are clicking on your result, it shows that the general population is intrigued by what you have in your page title. This is a user signal Google can easily pick up on and reward you for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pogo-sticking</strong> : Pogo sticking is the behavior of a user when they get to a SERP, click on a result, and then hit the 'back button' to the SERP and click on another result in an attempt to find a proper answer to their search query. I'm sure you can relate to this one.</p>
</li>
</ul>

image-1024x608-1.png"" /></a>(source: backlinko)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>RankBrain:</strong> RankBrain is ""a <a href=""https://jelvix.com/blog/ai-vs-machine-learning-vs-deep-learning"">machine learning</a>-based search engine algorithm .... that helps Google to process search results and provide more relevant search results for users"" (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RankBrain"">source</a>). Although not really a ""single Google Ranking Factor"" it is worth mentioning here as it does affect your SERP position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social Media Likes/Interaction</strong> : Real businesses get some kind of interaction on social. This is definitely a trust signal to Google. And don't fake it - Google can tell that too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Repeat Traffic</strong> : Repeat traffic is a fantastic way to show Google that your page is valuable. So valuable, in fact, that people come back again and again. Pro-tip: Use re-marketing to get people back to your page.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Brand Signal Ranking Factors</h3>
<pre><code>6 brand signal ranking factors
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authorship</strong> : Authorship ties content to an entity (person). This creates trust. If there is a notable or known, author we humans trust that person more (usually). Google works the same way:</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/authorship_as_a_google_ranking_signal.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/authorship_as_a_google_ranking_signal.png"" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Branded Searches</strong> : Google captures &amp; catalogs all searches. If a brand is getting <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/search-volume/"">search volume</a> for its brand name, then Google sees this as a trust signal - because the brand is notable enough that people are actively searching for it by name. The more, the better.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/brand-
search.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/brand-
search.png"" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Brand + KW Searches</strong> : The next logical evolution after a brand name search is brand + keyword search. From our personal testing, we have seen this helps build the trust of a website/brand.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/brand-kw-
search.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/brand-kw-
search.png"" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Brand Mentions:</strong> Brand mentions are anytime a website writes your brand name somewhere in their article. Maybe it was mentioned on Twitter, or maybe within the content of a post. For example, we just brand mentioned ""Twitter"" right there in the last sentence. Did you pick up on that?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Branded Anchor Text</strong> : Branded anchor text is normal. Big brands get alot of links pointing to them with their brand name as the clickable anchor text. For example, here is the anchor text profile for a large brand called Best Buy. Look how many links they have with branded anchors:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/branded-anchor-text-as-a-ranking-signal.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/branded-anchor-
text-as-a-ranking-signal-1024x622-1.png"" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/social-media-marketing-tools/""> <strong>Social Foundations</strong> : Having well established, completely filled out, and legitimately followed social media</a> accounts is a natural part of any brand building. These are key signs to Google that your website should be trusted.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Local Ranking Factors</h3>
<pre><code>10 local ranking factors
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Consistent Citations: Probably one of the most important local ranking factors, making sure that your business is listed properly &amp; consistently across all online directories is a huge task, and very important. If Google sees that all the only directories have the same information it gives Google a lot of confidence that the information is still accurate and trustworthy. Check the consistency of your online presence <a href=""https://www.optimizelocation.com/partner/serpco/diagnostic.html"">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Geo-Targeting</strong> : Some SEOs think that if your server (host) is local to the geography you are targeting, that you will get ranking preference. The jury is still out on this one. We don't really think it matters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Google My Business</strong> : Claim &amp; verify your Google My Business if you even want a <em>chance</em> to show up in the maps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Google My Business Categories</strong> : Google something local related, look at the categories that show up, and you will see how much weight categories carry. Fill them outright, and fully.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/GMB-categories-as-a-ranking-factor.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gmb-categories-as-
a-ranking-factor-1024x424-1.png"" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Links from Local sites</strong> : There are a lot of websites that are geo-specific. For example, if you are a business in Los Angeles, it would be very beneficial to get a link from the West LA Chamber of Commerce. Get those types of links, and your local rankings will love you for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Local Searches</strong> : For geo-related searches (ex: ""dentist near me"", ""dentist in los angeles"") Google will display a map pack. Make sure you have a verified Google My Business if you want the option of showing up there.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/law-firm-
marketing-company-shows-staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud-in-the-map-
pack.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/law-firm-
marketing-company-shows-staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud-in-the-map-
pack.png"" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Physical Location</strong> : Having a physical location is not a requirement, but it does show that your business is less likely to be a spammer than a real, trusted business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proximity to the Searcher</strong> : Being close to the origin of the searcher is a huge benefit to showing up locally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reviews</strong> : Both quality &amp; quantity. Google loves reviews because they are done by independent 3rd parties - a great source of trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Review Responses</strong> : The next best thing from reviews is responding to your reviews! This shows Google that the business is active and actually cares about its reputation, and how customers are being served.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Negative Ranking Factors</h3>
<pre><code>30 negative ranking factors
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Duplicate Content</strong> : Duplicate content is a huge no-no in the Google world. Check your website for <a href=""http://copyscape.com"">external duplicate content</a> &amp; <a href=""http://siteliner.com"">internal duplicate content</a>, and get the problem areas fixed ASAP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Duplicate Meta Info</strong> : Duplicate meta information falls under the duplicate content purview. Use <a href=""http://screamingfrog.com"">Screaming Frog</a> to check your metas, and make sure they are unique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/affiliate-marketing-programs/""> <strong>Affiliate Sites</strong> : Google knows that website owners need to make money to run their business, and affiliate marketing</a> is a legitimate way to do it. However, sites that are created solely to refer traffic away and make an affiliate commission are not looked favorably by Google. Try to show that you have at least some sliver of non-monetary reason to be there. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Affiliate Link Hiding</strong> : Hiding anything usually means you're up to no good. And if you just read the bullet point above, this one needs no explanation. Don't do this - or be very careful. Proceed at your own risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Autogenerated Content</strong> : This just screams spam. Google hates spam. Enough said.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cloaking</strong> : Cloaking is when you show a user one thing, but show a search engine another thing. This is intentionally and obviously deceptive. If you get caught by Google you will be penalized/de-indexed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Doorway Pages</strong> : Doorway pages are looked on as a kind of <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/black-hat-seo/"">black hat seo</a> trick, and Google does not like them. Full article <a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2721311?hl=en"">here</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>PageRank Sculpting</strong> : Page rank sculpting is defined as no-following all (or most) of your outbound links with the intention of keeping all your link power on the page, and not letting it flow out anywhere. Some SEOs think that Google picks up on this and will look unfavorably on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fred Update</strong> : Fred update targets low-quality pages. Keep them off your site, and you won't need to deal with Fred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Full Page Popups</strong> : Full page pop-ups, aka ""interstitial"" pop-ups, can be a bad user experience. Especially when they are hard to close, or there are multiple of them, or the user is on mobile, etc. Avoid annoying and unhelpful things and keep your user in mind, and your website rankings should benefit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IP Flagged as Spam</strong> : Obviously, if you have been flagged (or the host / IP you are on has been flagged) as spam, you will have a harder time earning trust. Avoid flagged IPs. Avoid bad neighborhoods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Linking to Bad Neighborhoods</strong> : Didn't we just say avoid bad neighborhoods? Yes, we did. Linking to (or getting links from) is a way of associating your website with others. Don't associate with stuff Google doesn't like. Only link out to websites you are 100% confident you can trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meta Tag KW Stuffing</strong> : Keyword stuffing anywhere is a no-no, and meta tags are just another place to not do that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Panda Penalty</strong> : A Panda Penalty is a content-related penalty. Usually having to do with thin/poor content or over-optimization of content. Don't over-optimize.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pop-up Ads / Distracting Ads</strong> : Are you old enough to remember how annoying the internet was just a few years ago? If you went to the wrong website you seriously had to shut down your computer to escape the onslaught of never-ending pop-ups. Users don't like it. Google doesn't like it. Don't do it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

internet not too many years ago</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Google Dance</strong> : The <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/google-dance/"">Google Dance</a> can shake up your rankings temporarily. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Google Sandbox</strong> : A heavily debated/contested topic in SEO, the Google Sandbox is basically what is responsible for link delays (ranking delays). When you get a link or links from a powerful site, Google does not ""fully release"" the full effect of the link power immediately. In fact, we have seen it take up to 9+ months for a link to fully kick in. You have the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_effect"">Google Sandbox Effect</a> to thank for that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hacked Site</strong> : If your site gets hacked, your rankings can be negatively impacted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Link Profile, High % of High/Low-Quality Links</strong> : This goes back to link diversity. You want to blend in. If you have an overly high % of links that are bad (or good even) your website will stand out, and your rankings can be affected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Links From Press Releases</strong> : Links from press releases can definitely hurt your site if you do them wrong. Getting a lot of dofollow links from a press release (especially if you use keyword anchor text) can seriously hurt your rankings for that keyword.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Links from the same Class IP Address</strong> : If all your links (or a high majority of them) are from the same IP Class (A, B, C) it looks suspicious, and probably is. Google notices that, and you can get penalized. We have seen this happen first hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Links From Unrelated Sites</strong> : Getting links from unrelated websites are said to not help you. In fact, we have tested this. A strong link from an unrelated website can definitely help your rankings. It's better to get a relevant one though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Low-Quality Directory Links</strong> : Getting links from directories that are irrelevant or low quality is something you probably want to stay away from. Check their traffic, DR, etc. and you will be fine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manual Actions</strong> : Manual actions definitely affect your rankings. Check Google Search Console to see if you have any manual actions that require your attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Penguin Penalty</strong> : If you get a Penguin Penalty your rankings will definitely be affected. This is a penalty that has to do with backlinks. If Google finds out (or suspects) that you have been manipulating your rankings, you will be penalized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reconsideration Request</strong> : If your rankings have been affected, you got a manual penalty, and you made the changes you can submit a reconsideration request to try and repair your rankings. It may take a while, it may not work - but definitely do it because it can save you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Selling Links</strong> : If you are caught selling links Google will penalize or de-index your website. It happens all the time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Sudden Influx of Links (without other signals)</strong> : As you probably know by now, anything unnatural that pops up on Google's radar is usually not a good thing. This applies to links as well. Sometimes websites naturally get a lot of links (breaking news, viral videos, etc.) but those are accompanied by a ton of other social signals. If you just get a bunch of links without traffic, shares, likes, etc. it looks very suspicious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Toxic Links</strong> : Some links are toxic. Make sure that the links your website has acquired are quality. And if they aren't good, disavow them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/LRT-toxic-links.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/lrt-toxic-
links-1024x577-1.png"" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Widget Links</strong> : Some developers use plugins to build links to their site. When you install a theme or plugin, it will automatically put a link back to their site. Google does not like this (but it works extremely well to build rankings).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Ranking Factors</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Browsing History</strong> : Browsing history can, and will, affect the SERP you see. Make sure that if you are checking your rankings, you are <a href=""https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en"">browsing incognito</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DMCA Complaints</strong> : If you violate internet copyright laws, and someone files a <a href=""https://www.dmca.com/"">DMCA complaint</a> Google gets that information and sees that you are not playing by the rules, and can/will affect your rankings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Domain Diversity</strong> : Google's Bigfoot update was intended to make sure that when you do a search, you see a diverse selection of domains. Aka, they don't want to have the same domain (URL) ranking multiple times on the page. They want to give the searched choices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Easter Eggs</strong> : Easter eggs in Google refer to searches that trigger interesting things. If you are trying to rank for one of these, good luck - your rankings will be affected. One of my favorites is from the video game ""Star Fox"". In Google Chrome, go to Google and <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=do+a+barrel+roll&amp;oq=do+a+barrel+roll&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3882j1j8&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"">search: do a barrel roll</a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rich Snippet / Featured Snippet</strong> : Featured snippets are a huge factor in ranking. First, if you are NOT the featured snippet, then the number of clicks you get from being on page 1 will be drastically lower than normal. Conversely, if you can get the rich snippet you will be snatching up a ton of clicks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Image Results</strong> : Image results are not necessarily a 'ranking factor' but they are something you will want. Images can drive results, and sometimes they do display in the regular SERP area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Payday Loans Update</strong> : The ""PayDay Loans"" update affects the rankings of spammy queries.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/payday-loans-update-as-a-google-ranking-factor.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/payday-loans-
update-as-a-google-ranking-
factor-1024x419-1.png"" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Query Deserves Freshness (QDF)</strong> : For certain search types, Google will boost the rankings of pages if they need (or ""deserve"") freshness. Think news, weather updates, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Query Deserves Diversity (QDD)</strong> : Google (potentially) recognizes search queries that have the potential for multiple different intents, like a search for the WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature  or World Wrestling Federation?) and attempt to modify the SERP results to include more options so the users intent is satisfied - no matter what they were searching for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Safe Search</strong> : Safe search is a Google feature that filters SERP results for the little ones. Parental controls basically. SERPs would have adult language and content removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shopping Results</strong> : If your search query has shopping intent attached to it, Googs will display shopping results (and ads) and that will affect the ranking of your page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Single Site Results</strong> : The opposite of QDD, single-site results will bring up the same site multiple times for a search. This primarily applies to brands. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Top Stories</strong> : The Top Stories Box is another <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/serp-features/"">SERP feature</a>, that if triggered will affect the rankings of your page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transactional Searches</strong> : SERP results will be altered if the search has transactional intent/value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>YMYL Keywords</strong> : YMYL = Your Money Your Life. This refers to searches that can significantly impact the health, wealth, or wellbeing of a person if they were to read the wrong (or right) information. Businesses in the YMYL niche are having all sorts of problems ranking for things as of right now (late 2019) as Google is making gigantic changes to their algorithm. Many businesses (even very large trusted websites are getting destroyed in the <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/serp/"">SERPs)</a>.</p>

[Here is the first dumbest.](https://devinschumacher.com/white-hat-seo/)

SEO's love making ? up.

On one hand, they kind of have the right to - after all it's a new industry
and someone's gotta start naming things.

On the other hand, you end up with a bunch of ?.

Black Hat SEO is one of those terms.

So, let's hold our noses and dive in.

## What is Black Hat SEO?

Black Hat SEO is colloquially to refer to as shady, sketchy, or risky SEO
practices - that you probably ""should avoid"".

Thats seriously it.

""Bad SEO"".

It has a bad rap because ""Black Hat SEO"" practices are typically less
sustainable and more short lived. Google algorithm loopholes that are
exploited ultra aggressively for short term gains, with little regard for long
term sustainability.

Once the exploit is found, Google releases an update to fix it. And then
usually goes out of its way to extra-penalize the people involved.

Personally, I don't like labels. So I'm not a big fan of calling something
""black"" vs. ""white"" hat. Furthermore, the term ""Black Hat SEO"" is almost
always used incorrectly in SEO anyways. So...double dumb.

## Black Hat SEO vs. White Hat SEO

Why is it used incorrectly? because technically anything you do intended to
manipulate a [search engine](https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/)
ranking is against Google's TOS.

So black hat = white hat = grey hat = no hat.

It's all the same.

 **Here's a screenshot straight outta Google's Webmaster Guidelines:**

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/googles-
websmaster-gudeliness-1024x619-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/googles-websmaster-gudeliness.png)

 **It basically says:**

  *  **Things to avoid** : everything
  *  **Things to do** : keep an eye on your site!

So according to Google, all SEO is the same thing.

**Black Hat SEO is** : The Dark Side of SEO

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/darth-vader-black-
hat-seogif.gif)

But seriously have we learned nothing from Star Wars?

  * The Force is the Force.
  * Power is power.
  * SEO is SEO. 

It was Anakin Skywalker who turned evil and became Vader ... because
apparently his idea of a hobby was to go around blowing up planets.

It is the **person (or business) using the power for BAD** that makes them
part of the dark side - not the power itself.

The Dark-side of the force can be used for good too:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-8.gif)

So the next logical question would be - why do people even use black hat seo
then, if it's so risky?

Well, the results are super powerful.

 **Black Hat SEO is** : high risk, high reward.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/roulette-gif-that-
black-hat-seo-is-risky.gif)

So calling something ""black hat"" or ""white hat"" is more like a level of
severity of a crime - like stealing a stick of gum vs. stealing a car.

Both (thefts) are illegal.

Both (forms of SEO) are against Googles Terms of Service.

But we SEO's (excluding myself) like our distinctions, and it is true that
some things in SEO are being watched with more scrutiny than others.

For example, using PBNs to rank a website is normally considered a ""black hat
seo technique"", but if you can do it right it is extremely powerful.

**Black Hat SEO is:** Risky Business.

But who doesn't like a little risky business?

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/black-hat-seo-
risky-business-gif.gif)

And one last final rant on why I don't like the term Black Hat SEO or White
Hat SEO is because of where the names come from.

The term ""black hat"" and ""white hat"" come from old spaghetti western films,
where the bad guys wear a black cowboy hat, and the good guys wear a white
cowboy hat.

Classic good vs. evil.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/black-hat-vs-white-
hat.jpg)

But in [SEO the ""techniques""](https://devinschumacher.com/seo-techniques/) or
""tactics"" you use have nothing to do with good & evil.

And none of the people talking about Black Hat SEO or White Hat SEO even
mention good v. evil - it's irrelevant!

So, in my opinion it's just one big giant poop of a misnomer for the reasons
we discussed (but I'll summarize them for you again anywhere because who
doesn't love a nice little summary section?

And let's be honest - most of ya'll prolly be skimming this article like:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/lol-did-not-read-
gif.gif)

 **Why ""Black Hat SEO"" is a ?y term:**

  1. Any action you do to your website intended to manipulate your search engine [ranking is against Google's](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/) TOS
  2. It refers to riskiness of techniques - not good v. evil
  3. Most people are attaching it to the wrong terms anyways. Some people say PBNs are Black Hat. Some say guest posts are Black Hat - there is no consensus anyways, so let's just stop labeling **?**.

I promise that was the last poop emoji I am going to use in this post.

## Should I Avoid Black Hat SEO?

So, if you look at other people's definitions of black hat seo, they actually
include the words ""avoid"" in their definitions quite frequently.

Here are some examples:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/a_definition_of_black_hat_search_engine_optimization-1024x158-1.png)![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/a_definition_of_black_hat_seo-1024x258-1.png)![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/recommendation_to_avoid_black_hat_seo-1024x97-1.png)![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/what_is_black_hat_seo-1024x314-1.png)

For a beginner that is probably sound advice.

And by no means are we telling you to throw caution to the wind and start
doing the riskier things - we just want you to be informed (and make a public
service announcement to the world) that black hat does not equal bad.

It is all about levels of risk.

How risky do you want to be in your business?

Maybe in the beginning it's okay to be more risky, and then as you progress
you pull back?

Maybe you have complete control over what you are doing and it's not risky for
you.

For example, should you drive a car over 100mph?

Most people would say ""no way thats too risky!""

But we say:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nascar-bar-
mark-e1567810208920.jpg)

It's all relative. It's all about capability & risk tolerance.

NASCAR is just one example of humans doing things that are normally considered
""too risky"" and having huge success with it.

Anyways - back to SEO.

## When you might want to roll the dice with Black Hat SEO

  * Your website is still new
  * You could easily make a new website if yours was penalized
  * Your industry is rife with black hat tactics
  * Your plan is to make money online with 'churn and burn'
  * You use them in moderation
  * You know how to recover websites from penalties
  * You are doing SEO outside of the USA

## 1\. Your website is still new

If your website is still new it doesn't matter much if you get penalized
because you can just start a new one.

## 2\. You could easily make a new website if yours was penalized

For example, let's say that your website does not represent a brick and mortar
brand.

Maybe you just run an affiliate site about diet supplements called
dietreviewsite.com

Your business relies on organic search rankings to drive sales, you have no
real ""brand"", and you built all your own links. If your domain is penalized
you can try to recover it - or just start a new site and re-use all the
content.

Swap out your network links to the new one, and boom you're good to go.

Yes, its still expensive and a P.I.T.A, but doing some black hat magic to
shoot up the [SERPs](https://devinschumacher.com/serp/) for highly competitive
(and high paying offers) is worth the risk. This was pretty prevalent in
emerging industries like Garcinia Cambogia, nootropics, etc.

## 3\. Your industry is rife with black hat tactics

Some industries, if you want to compete you gotta fight fire with fire. It's
that simple.

Gambling, payday loans, coupons, porn, etc. - and so you will find alot of
super black hat seo wizards rocking the SERPs with tactics I haven't even
heard of.

In my opinion, these guys are the true rockstars of SEO. And I don't
personally even know many of them. They stay hidden, and reel in the dough.

If you are one of these people I would love to meet you, so please [contact
me](https://www.facebook.com/MDSCH)[.](https://www.facebook.com/MDSCH)

## 4\. Your plan is to make money online with 'churn and burn'

If you know straight out the gate that you can spin up a giant website, rank
for a bunch of easy terms, and bring in traffic to monetize with
[Adsense](https://www.google.com/adsense/start/), or some other kind of offer
fully expecting that its gonna get burned then of course you will want to
Black hat as much as possible.

This business model relies around SPEED.

I see these types of sites alot around PPV events.

They rank for terms like ""Floyd Mayweather PPV free stream"" (usually using
parasite SEO) full well knowing that site isn't gonna be around for very long.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/black-hat-seos-
parasite-seo-to-stream-1024x801-1.png)

They use ""parasite SEO"" to piggyback on the trust and authority of bigger
websites like reddit & twitter to capture people looking to illegally stream
PPV events. And then make money off all the traffic because of Google Adsense,
collecting emails, etc.

## 5\. You use them in moderation

One of the primary tenets of good SEO is doing things ""naturally"". Try to make
everything you do look natural.

If you are mostly engaging in the less risky tactics, one or two Black Hat
power moves are probably gonna going to get you the Google slap.

## 6\. You know how to recover websites from penalties

We like trying out new SEO tactics on our website before recommending them, or
using them on client projects.

For the most part we stay away from ""Black Hat"" SEO tactics entirely for our
clients, but like I have been saying throughout this article - pretty much
everything is a no-no in Google's eyes, so we try things out on our site
first!

Has it gotten us into trouble before? Actually no.

We do things carefully. But we also offer penalty recovery services, so if
something were to happen to our site it would only be more practice.

We have dealt extensively with penalized websites and we know how to bring
them back from the dead.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/frankenstein-
gif.gif)

## 7\. You are doing SEO outside of the USA

Yes, this is a thing.

SEO outside of the USA (and to be fair outside of the UK, AUS & CAN) is much
easier.

The Google algorithm for other countries is just simply not as evolved as it
is in the aforementioned places.

In some cases, it is even a couple YEARS behind - so old black hat tricks from
the USA can work like gangbusters in South America and some other places where
the algo isn't quite as intense.

## Black Hat SEO Tools

Now to be honest, we don't do a whole lot of Black Hat SEO anymore.

And most of these tools are kind of trash, so use them at your own peril
(waste of money & potential harm to your site)

However we wanted to give you all the information needed to help you learn
about Black Hat SEO, so here they are:

  *  **Best Spinner** \- An article spinning software that actually works pretty well
  *  **Cloud Rank** \- A tool to help you automate & rank Youtube videos using embeds, PBNs & fake traffic
  *  **Cloud Social Signals** \- A [software that helps you automate](https://devinschumacher.com/marketing-automation-software/) & fake social signals to your website (re-tweets, Facebook likes, etc.)
  *  **Cloud Search** \- A tool to automate & fake traffic coming to a website
  *  **GSA Search Engine Ranker** \- An automated [link spam software that builds](https://devinschumacher.com/link-building/) links for you.
  *  **Rankwyz** \- A tool used for link spam. Creating, managing & buying links on 1000s of Web 2.0 profiles. They also have PBN management stuff in it. I have tried this tool many times, and every time I have a terrible experience. Not a fan.
  *  **SENuke** \- Automated article creation, link spam, etc.
  *  **Scrapebox** \- Not entirely black hat, this tool has alot of legit applications. But some of them are very spam oriented.

To be honest, there are alot more of these but I don't think I want to
continue to promote them.

So I'm gonna end it here.

## Final Thoughts

Whether you classify what you do as Black Hat SEO, or [White Hat
SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/white-hat-seo/) \- the important part is to
do SEO that works and fits within your business goals.

Here at SERP Co., we do what works. And we suggest you follow our lead if you

clients.

Keep following along with [SERP University](https://devin.to/email) to learn
more, and don't forget to connect with us on our other social platforms. We
put out different kinds of value on each one, and provide a ton of free value
all the time.","<p><strong>Black Hat SEO</strong> : The second dumbest term in Search Engine Optimization.</p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/white-hat-seo/"">Here is the first dumbest.</a></p>
<p>SEO's love making ? up.</p>
<p>On one hand, they kind of have the right to - after all it's a new industry
and someone's gotta start naming things.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you end up with a bunch of ?.</p>
<p>Black Hat SEO is one of those terms.</p>
<p>So, let's hold our noses and dive in.</p>
<h2>What is Black Hat SEO?</h2>
<p>Black Hat SEO is colloquially to refer to as shady, sketchy, or risky SEO
practices - that you probably ""should avoid"".</p>
<p>Thats seriously it.</p>
<p>""Bad SEO"".</p>
<p>It has a bad rap because ""Black Hat SEO"" practices are typically less
sustainable and more short lived. Google algorithm loopholes that are
exploited ultra aggressively for short term gains, with little regard for long
term sustainability.</p>
<p>Once the exploit is found, Google releases an update to fix it. And then
usually goes out of its way to extra-penalize the people involved.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't like labels. So I'm not a big fan of calling something
""black"" vs. ""white"" hat. Furthermore, the term ""Black Hat SEO"" is almost
always used incorrectly in SEO anyways. So...double dumb.</p>
<h2>Black Hat SEO vs. White Hat SEO</h2>
<p>Why is it used incorrectly? because technically anything you do intended to
manipulate a <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/"">search engine</a>
ranking is against Google's TOS.</p>
<p>So black hat = white hat = grey hat = no hat.</p>
<p>It's all the same.</p>
<p><strong>Here's a screenshot straight outta Google's Webmaster Guidelines:</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2019/09/googles-websmaster-gudeliness.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/googles-
websmaster-gudeliness-1024x619-1.png"" /></a></p>
<p><strong>It basically says:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Things to avoid</strong> : everything</li>
<li><strong>Things to do</strong> : keep an eye on your site!</li>
</ul>
<p>So according to Google, all SEO is the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>Black Hat SEO is</strong> : The Dark Side of SEO</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/darth-vader-black-
hat-seogif.gif"" /></p>
<p>But seriously have we learned nothing from Star Wars?</p>
<ul>
<li>The Force is the Force.</li>
<li>Power is power.</li>
<li>SEO is SEO. </li>
</ul>
<p>It was Anakin Skywalker who turned evil and became Vader ... because
apparently his idea of a hobby was to go around blowing up planets.</p>
<p>It is the <strong>person (or business) using the power for BAD</strong> that makes them
part of the dark side - not the power itself.</p>
<p>The Dark-side of the force can be used for good too:</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-8.gif"" /></p>
<p>So the next logical question would be - why do people even use black hat seo
then, if it's so risky?</p>
<p>Well, the results are super powerful.</p>
<p><strong>Black Hat SEO is</strong> : high risk, high reward.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/roulette-gif-that-
black-hat-seo-is-risky.gif"" /></p>
<p>So calling something ""black hat"" or ""white hat"" is more like a level of
severity of a crime - like stealing a stick of gum vs. stealing a car.</p>
<p>Both (thefts) are illegal.</p>
<p>Both (forms of SEO) are against Googles Terms of Service.</p>
<p>But we SEO's (excluding myself) like our distinctions, and it is true that
some things in SEO are being watched with more scrutiny than others.</p>
<p>For example, using PBNs to rank a website is normally considered a ""black hat
seo technique"", but if you can do it right it is extremely powerful.</p>
<p><strong>Black Hat SEO is:</strong> Risky Business.</p>
<p>But who doesn't like a little risky business?</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/black-hat-seo-
risky-business-gif.gif"" /></p>
<p>And one last final rant on why I don't like the term Black Hat SEO or White
Hat SEO is because of where the names come from.</p>
<p>The term ""black hat"" and ""white hat"" come from old spaghetti western films,
where the bad guys wear a black cowboy hat, and the good guys wear a white
cowboy hat.</p>
<p>Classic good vs. evil.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/black-hat-vs-white-
hat.jpg"" /></p>
<p>But in <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/seo-techniques/"">SEO the ""techniques""</a> or
""tactics"" you use have nothing to do with good &amp; evil.</p>
<p>And none of the people talking about Black Hat SEO or White Hat SEO even
mention good v. evil - it's irrelevant!</p>
<p>So, in my opinion it's just one big giant poop of a misnomer for the reasons
we discussed (but I'll summarize them for you again anywhere because who
doesn't love a nice little summary section?</p>
<p>And let's be honest - most of ya'll prolly be skimming this article like:</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/lol-did-not-read-
gif.gif"" /></p>
<p><strong>Why ""Black Hat SEO"" is a ?y term:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Any action you do to your website intended to manipulate your search engine <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/"">ranking is against Google's</a> TOS</li>
<li>It refers to riskiness of techniques - not good v. evil</li>
<li>Most people are attaching it to the wrong terms anyways. Some people say PBNs are Black Hat. Some say guest posts are Black Hat - there is no consensus anyways, so let's just stop labeling <strong>?</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I promise that was the last poop emoji I am going to use in this post.</p>
<h2>Should I Avoid Black Hat SEO?</h2>
<p>So, if you look at other people's definitions of black hat seo, they actually
include the words ""avoid"" in their definitions quite frequently.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/a_definition_of_black_hat_search_engine_optimization-1024x158-1.png"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/a_definition_of_black_hat_seo-1024x258-1.png"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/recommendation_to_avoid_black_hat_seo-1024x97-1.png"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/what_is_black_hat_seo-1024x314-1.png"" /></p>
<p>For a beginner that is probably sound advice.</p>
<p>And by no means are we telling you to throw caution to the wind and start
doing the riskier things - we just want you to be informed (and make a public
service announcement to the world) that black hat does not equal bad.</p>
<p>It is all about levels of risk.</p>
<p>How risky do you want to be in your business?</p>
<p>Maybe in the beginning it's okay to be more risky, and then as you progress
you pull back?</p>
<p>Maybe you have complete control over what you are doing and it's not risky for
you.</p>
<p>For example, should you drive a car over 100mph?</p>
<p>Most people would say ""no way thats too risky!""</p>
<p>But we say:</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/nascar-bar-
mark-e1567810208920.jpg"" /></p>
<p>It's all relative. It's all about capability &amp; risk tolerance.</p>
<p>NASCAR is just one example of humans doing things that are normally considered
""too risky"" and having huge success with it.</p>
<p>Anyways - back to SEO.</p>
<h2>When you might want to roll the dice with Black Hat SEO</h2>
<ul>
<li>Your website is still new</li>
<li>You could easily make a new website if yours was penalized</li>
<li>Your industry is rife with black hat tactics</li>
<li>Your plan is to make money online with 'churn and burn'</li>
<li>You use them in moderation</li>
<li>You know how to recover websites from penalties</li>
<li>You are doing SEO outside of the USA</li>
</ul>
<h2>1. Your website is still new</h2>
<p>If your website is still new it doesn't matter much if you get penalized
because you can just start a new one.</p>
<h2>2. You could easily make a new website if yours was penalized</h2>
<p>For example, let's say that your website does not represent a brick and mortar
brand.</p>
<p>Maybe you just run an affiliate site about diet supplements called
dietreviewsite.com</p>
<p>Your business relies on organic search rankings to drive sales, you have no
real ""brand"", and you built all your own links. If your domain is penalized
you can try to recover it - or just start a new site and re-use all the
content.</p>
<p>Swap out your network links to the new one, and boom you're good to go.</p>
<p>Yes, its still expensive and a P.I.T.A, but doing some black hat magic to
shoot up the <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/serp/"">SERPs</a> for highly competitive
(and high paying offers) is worth the risk. This was pretty prevalent in
emerging industries like Garcinia Cambogia, nootropics, etc.</p>
<h2>3. Your industry is rife with black hat tactics</h2>
<p>Some industries, if you want to compete you gotta fight fire with fire. It's
that simple.</p>
<p>Gambling, payday loans, coupons, porn, etc. - and so you will find alot of
super black hat seo wizards rocking the SERPs with tactics I haven't even
heard of.</p>
<p>In my opinion, these guys are the true rockstars of SEO. And I don't
personally even know many of them. They stay hidden, and reel in the dough.</p>
<p>If you are one of these people I would love to meet you, so please <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/MDSCH"">contact
me</a><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/MDSCH"">.</a></p>
<h2>4. Your plan is to make money online with 'churn and burn'</h2>
<p>If you know straight out the gate that you can spin up a giant website, rank
for a bunch of easy terms, and bring in traffic to monetize with
<a href=""https://www.google.com/adsense/start/"">Adsense</a>, or some other kind of offer
fully expecting that its gonna get burned then of course you will want to
Black hat as much as possible.</p>
<p>This business model relies around SPEED.</p>
<p>I see these types of sites alot around PPV events.</p>
<p>They rank for terms like ""Floyd Mayweather PPV free stream"" (usually using
parasite SEO) full well knowing that site isn't gonna be around for very long.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/black-hat-seos-
parasite-seo-to-stream-1024x801-1.png"" /></p>
<p>They use ""parasite SEO"" to piggyback on the trust and authority of bigger
websites like reddit &amp; twitter to capture people looking to illegally stream
PPV events. And then make money off all the traffic because of Google Adsense,
collecting emails, etc.</p>
<h2>5. You use them in moderation</h2>
<p>One of the primary tenets of good SEO is doing things ""naturally"". Try to make
everything you do look natural.</p>
<p>If you are mostly engaging in the less risky tactics, one or two Black Hat
power moves are probably gonna going to get you the Google slap.</p>
<h2>6. You know how to recover websites from penalties</h2>
<p>We like trying out new SEO tactics on our website before recommending them, or
using them on client projects.</p>
<p>For the most part we stay away from ""Black Hat"" SEO tactics entirely for our
clients, but like I have been saying throughout this article - pretty much
everything is a no-no in Google's eyes, so we try things out on our site
first!</p>
<p>Has it gotten us into trouble before? Actually no.</p>
<p>We do things carefully. But we also offer penalty recovery services, so if
something were to happen to our site it would only be more practice.</p>
<p>We have dealt extensively with penalized websites and we know how to bring
them back from the dead.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/frankenstein-
gif.gif"" /></p>
<h2>7. You are doing SEO outside of the USA</h2>
<p>Yes, this is a thing.</p>
<p>SEO outside of the USA (and to be fair outside of the UK, AUS &amp; CAN) is much
easier.</p>
<p>The Google algorithm for other countries is just simply not as evolved as it
is in the aforementioned places.</p>
<p>In some cases, it is even a couple YEARS behind - so old black hat tricks from
the USA can work like gangbusters in South America and some other places where
the algo isn't quite as intense.</p>
<h2>Black Hat SEO Techniques &amp; Tactics</h2>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> : These are not MY opinion of black hat SEO techniques. This
is a list that I have compiled from every article out there that list black
hat SEO techniques.</p>
<p>Why am I doing this? Because I want to continue to illustrate how ridiculous
this is.</p>

 **White Hat SEO** : The first dumbest term in Search Engine Optimization.

[Here is the second dumbest.](https://devinschumacher.com/black-hat-seo/)

White Hat SEO is even more of a misnomer than Black Hat SEO.

## What is White Hat SEO?

White Hat SEO is colloquially to refer to as safe, legit, or sustainable SEO
practices, that you probably ""should concentrate on"".

That's really it!

""Good SEO"".

 **White Hat SEO is** : The Light Side of The Force

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-9.gif)

It has a good connotation because ""White Hat SEO"" practices are typically more
sustainable and less short lived than black hat seo.

If you have read our [article about black hat
seo](https://devinschumacher.com/black-hat-seo/) then you know my feelings
about labeling something Black vs. White hat in the SEO game because they are
both the same.

At least with [Black hat SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/black-hat-seo/) the
practices are a bit MORE shady. But with ""White Hat SEO"" this is totally a
wrong definition because White Hat SEOs are 100% trying to
influence/manipulate their search engine rankings. And that is **definitely**
against Google's TOS.

A better name for it would be ""Hypocrite SEO""

Guys, I know we joke alot about bad vs. good in these Black Hat & White Hat
debates, **but the bottom line is this** :

If you run a business that you want to spend time, money, effort & energy
building for the long term - then it is probably best you try and stick to the
**least risky** things possible.

I hope thats obvious.

Be safe out there, for the internet is dark and full of terrors (and GIFs,
apparently).

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/tumblr_m3b94urt1c1rtvp2io6_250.gif)

So for the rest of the article, we will leave this philosophical debate and
focus on giving you some actionable tips about White hat SEO.

 **White Hat SEO is** : Safety First.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-7.gif)

## White Hat SEO, Explained

What Google wants you to do instead is ""prepare"" your content in a way that
helps THEM organize it better.

Really, what they have done, is create this [$80 billion dollar
industry](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2018/07/30/seo-industry-
approaching-80-billion-but-all-you-want-is-more-web-traffic/#76dfc2557337) of
people who are working for Google without Google actually paying them.

Google publishes their list of guidelines of what they WANT you to do (notice
I didn't say ""a list of guidelines of what will make your site rank better"",
although there is some overlap) so that you will spend your time preparing
(optimizing) your website so it's easier for their web-crawler,
[Googlebot](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/182072?hl=en), to
understand your site better and make their life easier.

 **Here are some of Google resources for what you should do as an SEO (this
would be the closest thing to White Hat SEO):**

  * [Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Starter Guide](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en)
  * [Google Webmaster Guidelines](http://Webmaster Guidelines)
  * [Google Search Quality Raters Guidelines](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Google-Search-Quality-Rater-Guidelines.pdf)

Okay so thats like 200+ pages of super boring dry reading.

I know you're not here for that. #TLDR (Too Long, Didn't Read)

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/too-long-didnt-
read-gif.gif)

The key takeaway here is that Google is not going to give out its secret
formula to ranking on its [search engine](https://devinschumacher.com/search-
engines/).

That would be stupid.

Instead, it's going to publish a bunch of information (and much
misinformation) that is actually geared towards making the algorithm's job
much easier. So it can take information of all of our websites (me and you
included) and display it to it's users on the
[SERP](https://devinschumacher.com/serp/) (search engine results page).

My prediction, is that one day Google SERP clicks are going to go so low,
because all the information a searcher needs will be displayed ON the SERP,
and there will not even be a need to click through to the actual website.

 **For example** : no need to go to NFL.com anymore for the scores

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-serp-
screenshot-of-nfl-1024x587-1.png)

So that is why ""White Hat SEO"" is a misnomer, just like [black hat
seo](https://devinschumacher.com/black-hat-seo/).

We SEOs use it to say ""what kind of SEO tactics and tricks can we do that
Google ""approves"". But really, Google just wants you organizing your site, not
building ""good links"" and ""guest posting"", etc. More on this later.

 **White Hat SEO** is: slower, but safer

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/slow-moving-white-
hat-seo-turlte.gif)

.ugb-7f675af .ugb-blockquote__quote{width:70px !important;height:70px
!important}

White Hat SEO is the term we (not Google) give to label certain search engine
optimization tactics/strategies as 'safe' or 'sustainable' for your website.
Whereas Black hat seo would signify the search engine optimization
tactics/strategies that are 'risky' for your website.

## White Hat SEO Techniques & Tactics

So now that you understand what White Hat SEO is, let's talk about some of the
generally accepted white hat seo techniques, tactics, tricks & strategies that
you can use in your business and feel generally safe about (there is always a
risk of doing something wrong, or Google changing their mind about what they
like, but you can't live your entire life on what-ifs. Get out there and SEO a
little).

>  **Pro tip:** One easy distinction to understand if what you are about to do
> is white hat seo vs. black hat seo, is look at how much automating & mass
> producing you are doing. If you are using bots, scrapers, spinners, and
> producing and/or sending out non-personalized information, it's probably

 **White Hat SEO Techniques, By Category:**

  1. Local

### White Hat Local SEO Techniques

  * Claim your business on Google My Business
  * Claim the Foundational [Citations](https://devinschumacher.com/citations/) (Yext, Facebook, Bing, Yahoo, Apple Maps, etc.)
  * Fully complete (filled out with descriptions, hours, videos, images, etc.) all your listings
  * Submit your business to trusted data aggregators

The foundations of establishing your business as an actual business (and not
just a website) in Google's eyes is to make sure your business is **claimed &
listed** everywhere that Google expects a real business to be.

Next, you want to make sure that your business information is listed
consistently & accurately across all these online directories, so Google will
trust the information is up-to-date and reliable.

### Check Your Business Listing Accuracy

If you have already claimed your Google My Business listing, I highly
recommend you check your business listing accuracy across the web right now.

<p>Guys, I know we joke alot about bad vs. good in these Black Hat &amp; White Hat
debates, <strong>but the bottom line is this</strong> :</p>
<p>If you run a business that you want to spend time, money, effort &amp; energy
building for the long term - then it is probably best you try and stick to the
<strong>least risky</strong> things possible.</p>
<p>I hope thats obvious.</p>
<p>Be safe out there, for the internet is dark and full of terrors (and GIFs,
apparently).</p>

<p>So for the rest of the article, we will leave this philosophical debate and
focus on giving you some actionable tips about White hat SEO.</p>
<p><strong>White Hat SEO is</strong> : Safety First.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-7.gif"" /></p>
<h2>White Hat SEO, Explained</h2>
<p>What Google wants you to do instead is ""prepare"" your content in a way that
helps THEM organize it better.</p>
<p>Really, what they have done, is create this <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2018/07/30/seo-industry-
approaching-80-billion-but-all-you-want-is-more-web-traffic/#76dfc2557337"">$80 billion dollar
industry</a> of
people who are working for Google without Google actually paying them.</p>
<p>Google publishes their list of guidelines of what they WANT you to do (notice
I didn't say ""a list of guidelines of what will make your site rank better"",
although there is some overlap) so that you will spend your time preparing
(optimizing) your website so it's easier for their web-crawler,
<a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/182072?hl=en"">Googlebot</a>, to
understand your site better and make their life easier.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some of Google resources for what you should do as an SEO (this
would be the closest thing to White Hat SEO):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en"">Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Starter Guide</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://Webmaster Guidelines"">Google Webmaster Guidelines</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Google-Search-Quality-Rater-Guidelines.pdf"">Google Search Quality Raters Guidelines</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Okay so thats like 200+ pages of super boring dry reading.</p>
<p>I know you're not here for that. #TLDR (Too Long, Didn't Read)</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/too-long-didnt-
read-gif.gif"" /></p>
<p>The key takeaway here is that Google is not going to give out its secret
formula to ranking on its <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/search-
engines/"">search engine</a>.</p>
<p>That would be stupid.</p>
<p>Instead, it's going to publish a bunch of information (and much
misinformation) that is actually geared towards making the algorithm's job
much easier. So it can take information of all of our websites (me and you
included) and display it to it's users on the
<a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/serp/"">SERP</a> (search engine results page).</p>
<p>My prediction, is that one day Google SERP clicks are going to go so low,
because all the information a searcher needs will be displayed ON the SERP,
and there will not even be a need to click through to the actual website.</p>
<p><strong>For example</strong> : no need to go to NFL.com anymore for the scores</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/google-serp-
screenshot-of-nfl-1024x587-1.png"" /></p>
<p>So that is why ""White Hat SEO"" is a misnomer, just like <a href=""https://devinschumacher.com/black-hat-seo/"">black hat
seo</a>.</p>
<p>We SEOs use it to say ""what kind of SEO tactics and tricks can we do that
Google ""approves"". But really, Google just wants you organizing your site, not
building ""good links"" and ""guest posting"", etc. More on this later.</p>
<p><strong>White Hat SEO</strong> is: slower, but safer</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/slow-moving-white-
hat-seo-turlte.gif"" /></p>
<p>.ugb-7f675af .ugb-blockquote__quote{width:70px !important;height:70px
!important}</p>
<p>White Hat SEO is the term we (not Google) give to label certain search engine
optimization tactics/strategies as 'safe' or 'sustainable' for your website.
Whereas Black hat seo would signify the search engine optimization
tactics/strategies that are 'risky' for your website.</p>
<h2>White Hat SEO Techniques &amp; Tactics</h2>
<p>So now that you understand what White Hat SEO is, let's talk about some of the
generally accepted white hat seo techniques, tactics, tricks &amp; strategies that
you can use in your business and feel generally safe about (there is always a
risk of doing something wrong, or Google changing their mind about what they
like, but you can't live your entire life on what-ifs. Get out there and SEO a
little).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> One easy distinction to understand if what you are about to do
is white hat seo vs. black hat seo, is look at how much automating &amp; mass
producing you are doing. If you are using bots, scrapers, spinners, and
producing and/or sending out non-personalized information, it's probably
closer to black hat.</p>

## What Are Hyperlinks?

Hyperlinks were the original way of connecting documents on the internet.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/hyperlinks-in-the-
original-internet.png)A map of the entire internet, waaay back in the day.
Circa 1977.

  *  **Hyperlinks** take users (and [search engine](https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/) robots/crawlers) from Point A to Point B.
  *  **Hyperlinks** are the #1 most important [SEO ranking factor](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/).
  *  **Hyperlinks** are the foundation of the internet.

Let's just jump right in and **define hyperlinks** , because these bad boys
are the star of the show when it comes to search engine optimization.

 **Hyperlink Definition** : In the world of computing & internet-ing a
**hyperlink** (also known as a "" **link** "") is a clickable reference from one
point in a document to another point in the same, or different, document that
a person can ""click"" and be taken to the referenced material.

Hyperlinks are everywhere.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/hyperlinks-are-
everywhere.gif)

You've already seen at least 2 in this article alone.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/hyperlinks_are_everywhere_img.png)

## The Importance of Hyperlinks

Originally, hyperlinks were used to cite resources or references with an easy-
to-access ""clickable"" piece of text that would take you directly to the
reference, how convenient.

A clickable piece of text is called a text based hyperlink, and the clickable
part of the test is called the ""[anchor
text](https://devinschumacher.com/anchor-text/)"". If you're reading this
article wanting to get better at SEO – remember the term **anchor text**. It
is HUGELY important in [SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/what-is-seo/).

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/anchor-text-is-a-
critical-moment-in-learning-seo-1.gif)

In order to rank a website in Google (or any other [search
engine](https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/) for that matter) you need
a website that is properly built using correct [on-page seo
techniques](https://devinschumacher.com/on-page-seo/), so Google can easily
understand it, **and** your website needs to have some kind of trust &
authority – which is achieved by getting _other websites to link to you_ ,
called [link building](https://devinschumacher.com/link-building/).

When another website links _to your website_ , this is referred to as getting
a ""[backlink](https://devinschumacher.com/backlinks/)"" from that website, and
this has been the number 1 [Google SEO ranking
factor](https://devinschumacher.com/google-ranking-factors/) for a very long
time.

And **trust me when I say, links are here to stay.** It rhymes, so you know
it's real.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-1.gif)

With SEO being just one example, it is pretty clear that hyperlinks are now
used for many different purposes above just citing sources, and there are many
more **types of hyperlinks** that just ""text based links"".

## Types of Hyperlinks

  * Text links
  * Image links
  * Inline links
  * Anchor links
  * Internal links
  * External links
  * Fat links

### Text links

Text hyperlinks, aka text-based links, are the most obvious and common links.
You have already seen like 10 of them in this article alone and read about
them as well. Text links are clickable pieces of text that you can use to
navigate to another document/resource/etc.

### Image links

Image links are clickable _images_ , rather than text.

The most common place you see this are banner advertisements on websites.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-
link-1024x584-1.png)

Here is an example of an image link:

[![This is a picture of the homepage of SERP Co, which is a digital marketing
agency.](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/staging-
devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud-homepage-the-best-digital-marketing-
agency-1024x730-1.png)](https://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud)

### Inline links

 **Inline links** (aka ""hotlinks"", ""hot-linking"", and ""leeching"") are a way of
using a resource from another website on your website.

Inline linking involved using a resource on another server (someone else has a
website hosted on a server you don't own or operate) and you ""produce"" that
resource on your website without actually owning, or having, the media.

[Black hat SEO](https://devinschumacher.com/black-hat-seo/)s have used hot-
links in the past as a negative seo tactic.

Let's not go down that rabbit hole right now.

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-2.gif)

### Anchor links

 **Anchor links** , sometimes called ""jump links"" take you from one place on a
document to anther place on the _same_ document. You see these most commonly
in ""Table of Contents"" on articles or large guides (think Wikipedia).

But, in case you want to try one out right now, I have created an anchor link
for you – go ahead, click this and say ""WEEEE"" as you get shot all the way
back up the page.

### Internal Links

Internal links are hyperlinks that point to another page on the same website.

For example, here on this article that you are reading called ""Hyperlinks"",
whenever we link to another article on a _different page/URL_ of our website –
that would be an internal link. [Like this internal link sending you to the
SERP Co homepage.](https://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud)

[Internal links](https://devinschumacher.com/internal-links/) are not to be
confused with anchor links – anchor links link to a different place on the
same page/URL, where an internal links links to a different page/URL on the
same website, but not the same URL._

### External Links

External links are hyperlinks that take you to another domain.

[Here is an example of an external link that will take you to SERP
Dental](https://serpdental.com).

### Fat links

Fat links (aka ""one-to-many links"", ""multi links"", and ""extended links"") are
hyperlinks that lead to multiple destinations. One link, many destinations.

I don't have the ability to create them simply using HTML, so unfortunately I
cannot give you an example in this article, but there is a super rad article
about them where you can see a bunch of examples [here](https://next-
nexus.info/webdev/play/fatlinks/).

Fat links can open multiple windows, multiple tabs, or just open a dialogue
box with multiple link options!

## How to Create a Hyperlink

A traditional hyperlink is made up of a few [html
elements](https://devinschumacher.com/seo-html-elements/). Let's run a quick
example so you get it.

[This is a link to SERP Co](http://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud).

  1.  **The Anchor Tags** : <a> </a>
  2.  **The Hypertext Reference** Tag : href
  3.  **The URL** : https://staging-devinschumacher.kinsta.cloud
  4.  **The Anchor text** : This is a link to SERP Co.

If you know how to put these together, then you know **how to hyperlink**.

On the ""backend"" (aka the HTML) our example looks like this:

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/screen-
shot-2020-04-05-at-1.26.55-pm.png)

This is not a course on HTML, but basically what you see is the 1. Anchor Tag,
then the 2. Hypertext Reference Tag, then the 3. URL, and then the 4. Anchor
Text.

  * The **Anchor Tag** creates the link.
  * The **Hypertext Reference Tag** designates where the link will be going.
  * The **URL** is the address/destination.
  * The **Anchor Text** is the clickable portion of the link.

[Anchor Text](https://devinschumacher.com/anchor-text/) tells humans & [search
engines](https://devinschumacher.com/search-engines/) a little about what the
link is about.

If your website gets alot of links with anchor text surrounding ""seo agency"",
then Google will begin to understand your website is that of an [seo
agency](https://devinschumacher.com/) – and this is a critical [off page seo
strategy](https://devinschumacher.com/off-page-seo/) that you can use to help
your website rank for [keywords](https://devinschumacher.com/seo-keywords/).

## Hyperlink Attributes & Properties

In HTML, attributes define additional characteristics or properties of of an
element. This applies for hyperlinks.

Essentially, hyperlink attributes give links ""extra powers"".

![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/download-3.gif)

There are way too many hyperlink attributes to cover here. In fact, it would
require its own series of articles to be comprehensive so let's just cover the
ones most important for SEO – this would be the ""REL"" attribute.

[![](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2022/08/hyperlink_attributes-
rel-1024x715-1.png)](https://devinschumacher.com/wp-
content/uploads/2020/04/hyperlink_attributes-REL.png)

As you can see, even looking at one attribute there are still a ton of values
– lot's of options for augmenting links. These are the ones you **need** to
know:

  *  **Dofollow** \- ""dofollow"" is the default attribute of a link. It tells search engine crawlers to ['follow' the link](https://devinschumacher.com/do-follow-links/). It is a sign of trust, and it is how seo link power pass from one website to another through links.
  *  **Nofollow** \- ""nofollow"" is the opposite of dofollow. It is an attribute you add to a [link when you do not trust the destination where you are linking or you want to specifically tell search engines to not follow](https://devinschumacher.com/no-follow-links/) the link. It does not pass seo link power like a dofollow link would.
  *  **Sponsored** \- the ""sponsored"" element tells search engines (Google) that the link on your website has been paid for. You can imagine this is not as beneficial for SEO power as a dofollow link, because essentially you are telling Google that you are buying links.
  *  **UGC** \- the ""ugc"" tag stands for User Generated Content. If Google knows that something was created by the user (for example: you post on your Twitter and link to your website).

You can add these attributes to your links in the HTML, by adding a **rel=""""**
right after the URL
